1 1628 82 MINDFULNESS, SELF-COMPASSION, ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION MEASURES IN SOUTH AUSTRALIAN YOGA PARTICIPANTS: IMPLICATIONS FOR DESIGNING A YOGA INTERVENTION. AIM: THE AIM OF THE STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE THE DEMOGRAPHIC AND PRACTICE CHARACTERISTICS OF CURRENT YOGA PARTICIPANTS AND ASSESS THEIR LEVELS OF MINDFULNESS, SELF-COMPASSION, STRESS, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION AND WELLBEING AND IMPLICATIONS FOR DESIGNING A YOGA INTERVENTION. METHODS: A WEB-BASED SURVEY WAS ADMINISTERED TO SOUTH AUSTRALIAN YOGA TEACHERS AND STUDENTS FROM SEPTEMBER 2014 TO FEBRUARY 2015. RESULTS: RESULTS SHOWED A POSITIVE CORRELATION WITH MINDFULNESS AND SELF-COMPASSION AND NEGATIVE CORRELATION WITH DEPRESSION, ANXIETY AND STRESS SCORES WITH MONTHS OF PRACTICE. MINDFULNESS AND SELF-COMPASSION SCORES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER WITH TWO OR MORE CLASSES PER WEEK AND MINDFULNESS HIGHER IN THOSE WITH A REGULAR MEDITATION PRACTICE. DISCUSSION: KEY FINDINGS INDICATE THAT CLASS FREQUENCY, PRACTICE EXPERIENCE AND MEDITATION PRACTICE ARE IMPORTANT FACTORS IN DESIGNING A YOGA INTERVENTION EXAMINING MINDFULNESS AND MENTAL HEALTH. CONCLUSION: FINDINGS PROVIDE IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR GUIDING DEVELOPMENT OF A YOGA INTERVENTION FOR ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
2  262 36 ACUTE AND CUMULATIVE EFFECTS OF VINYASA YOGA ON AFFECT AND STRESS AMONG COLLEGE STUDENTS PARTICIPATING IN AN EIGHT-WEEK YOGA PROGRAM: A PILOT STUDY. BACKGROUND: COLLEGE STUDENTS ARE VULNERABLE TO A CRITICAL PERIOD IN DEVELOPMENTAL MATURATION, FACING RIGOROUS ACADEMIC WORK AND LEARNING HOW TO FUNCTION INDEPENDENTLY. WESTERN AEROBIC EXERCISE (WAE), SUCH AS RUNNING AND BICYCLING, HAS BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE MOOD AND RELIEVE STRESS. HOWEVER, COLLEGE STUDENTS OFTEN HAVE LOW LEVELS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. YOGA IS AN ANCIENT PHYSICAL AND MENTAL PRACTICE THAT MAY AFFECT MOOD AND STRESS. HOWEVER, RIGOROUS STUDIES EXAMINING THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF YOGA ARE RARE IN PEERREVIEWED WESTERN JOURNALS. THE AIM OF THIS RESEARCH WAS TO ESTABLISH PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE FOR THE ACUTE EFFECTS OF VINYASA YOGA ON AFFECT AND STRESS IN YOUNG-ADULT COLLEGE STUDENTS. METHODS: TWENTY HEALTHY COLLEGE STUDENTS AGE 18 YEARS AND OLDER WERE RECRUITED TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PILOT STUDY. PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED A VINYASA YOGA CLASS AT A LOCAL STUDIO TWICE WEEKLY FOR 8 WEEKS. AFFECT AND STRESS WERE ASSESSED BEFORE AND AFTER EACH YOGA SESSION. MEASURES INCLUDED THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE AFFECTIVE SCHEDULE (PANAS) AND THE COHEN PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE. RESULTS: POSITIVE AFFECT SCORES INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY (P < 0.05) FOR 14 OF THE 16 YOGA SESSIONS (MEAN INCREASE = 23.2%). NEGATIVE AFFECT DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PRE- TO POSTYOGA (P < 0.05) FOR 15 OF THE 16 SESSIONS (MEAN DECREASE = 22%). REPEATED MEASURES ANOVAS EXAMINING PRE-POST COMPOSITE SCORES ACROSS ALL 8 WEEKS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN PANAS, BUT NOT STRESS SCORES. CONCLUSIONS: FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT YOGA PRACTICE IS ASSOCIATED WITH ACUTE IMPROVEMENTS IN AFFECT IN A YOUNG-ADULT COLLEGE POPULATION. FUTURE RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO EXAMINE THE EXTENT TO WHICH DIFFERENT TYPES OF YOGA ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF DIFFERENT COLLEGE SUB-POPULATIONS (E.G., EATING DISORDERED, OVERWEIGHT/OBESE, SEDENTARY, AND SMOKERS).	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                             
3   96 26 A NATURALISTIC STUDY OF YOGA, MEDITATION, SELF-PERCEIVED STRESS, SELF-COMPASSION, AND MINDFULNESS IN COLLEGE STUDENTS. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY COMPARED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA AND MINDFULNESS MEDITATION ON SELF-COMPASSION, MINDFULNESS, AND PERCEIVED STRESS IN COLLEGE STUDENTS; AND EXPLORED MIND-BODY MECHANISMS AND PREDICTORS OF STRESS REDUCTION. PARTICIPANTS: STUDENT PARTICIPANTS (N = 92) WERE ENROLLED IN EITHER YOGA OR MINDFULNESS MEDITATION CLASSES AT A COLLEGE IN THE SOUTHERN UNITED STATES FROM AUGUST THROUGH MAY OF 2015-2016. METHODS: STUDENTS PARTICIPATED IN 50-MINUTE CLASSES TWICE A WEEK FOR 10 WEEKS, COMPLETING SELF-REPORT QUESTIONNAIRES DURING THE 1ST AND 10TH WEEK. RESULTS: MULTIPLE-LINEAR REGRESSION ANALYSIS FOUND CHANGE IN SELF-COMPASSION WAS THE STRONGEST PREDICTOR OF STRESS REDUCTION. CONCLUSIONS: INCREASING SELF-COMPASSION MAY INCREASE THE EFFICACY OF MIND-BODY INTERVENTIONS. RESEARCH INTO MIND-BODY MECHANISMS IS NEEDED TO IDENTIFY INTERVENTION COMPONENTS THAT MOST IMPROVE STUDENT WELL-BEING.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
4 1428 35 IMPROVEMENTS IN PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL WELL-BEING FOLLOWING A BRIEF YOGA-BASED PROGRAM FOR EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS. OBJECTIVE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE CHANGES IN PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL WELL-BEING IN EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS WHO ATTENDED A YOGA-BASED PROGRAM. METHODS: EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS WHO ATTENDED A 3-DAY YOGA-BASED RISE (RESILIENCE, INTEGRATION, SELF-AWARENESS, ENGAGEMENT) PROGRAM WERE RECRUITED TO PARTICIPATE. RISE WAS ADMINISTERED AT THE KRIPALU CENTER FOR YOGA & HEALTH. MEASURES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL WELL-BEING, AND HEALTH-RELATED BEHAVIORS WERE COMPLETED BEFORE (BASELINE), AFTER (POST), AND 2 MONTHS AFTER RISE (FOLLOW-UP). FORTY-FOUR PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED BASELINE AND POST AND WERE INCLUDED IN THE ANALYSIS. OF THOSE, 33 PARTICIPANTS ALSO COMPLETED THE FOLLOW-UP. PAIRED SAMPLES T TESTS WERE USED TO COMPARE SCORES BETWEEN TIME POINTS. RESULTS: COMPARED TO BASELINE, AT POST, PARTICIPANTS SHOWED IMPROVEMENTS IN PERCEIVED STRESS, MINDFULNESS, EMPOWERMENT, POSITIVE AFFECT, NEGATIVE AFFECT, SELF-COMPASSION, TOTAL WORK ENGAGEMENT, VIGOR, SLEEP QUALITY (ALL P VALUES < .001), RESILIENCE, SATISFACTION WITH LIFE, AS WELL AS EXHAUSTION AND PROFESSIONAL EFFICACY WHICH ARE DIMENSIONS OF BURNOUT (ALL P VALUES < .01). AT THE FOLLOW-UP, SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WERE MAINTAINED FOR MINDFULNESS, EMPOWERMENT, SELF-COMPASSION, SLEEP QUALITY (ALL P VALUES < .001), RESILIENCE, VIGOR, AND EXHAUSTION (ALL P VALUES < .01) AND POSITIVE AFFECT, SATISFACTION WITH LIFE, AND WORK ENGAGEMENT (ALL P VALUES < .05). CONCLUSIONS: THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT THE YOGA-BASED RISE PROGRAM IMPROVES PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL WELL-BEING IN EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS. IN ADDITION, PARTICIPANTS REPORTED THAT ATTENDING RISE WAS FEASIBLE, THEY COULD CONTINUE USING RISE PRACTICES LONG-TERM, SHARED THEM WITH WORK COLLEAGUES, AND REPORTED THAT RISE POSITIVELY IMPACTED BOTH THEIR DAILY LIVES AND WORKPLACE ENVIRONMENT. WITH THESE PROMISING RESULTS, ADDITIONAL CONTROLLED RESEARCH IS WARRANTED.	2019	
                                                                                                                             
5  444 19 CHAIR YOGA: BENEFITS FOR COMMUNITY-DWELLING OLDER ADULTS WITH OSTEOARTHRITIS. THE AIM OF THIS PILOT STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE WHETHER CHAIR YOGA WAS EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING PAIN LEVEL AND IMPROVING PHYSICAL FUNCTION AND EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING IN A SAMPLE OF COMMUNITY-DWELLING OLDER ADULTS WITH OSTEOARTHRITIS. ONE-WAY REPEATED MEASURES ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE WAS PERFORMED TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CHAIR YOGA AT BASELINE, MIDPOINT (4 WEEKS), AND END OF THE INTERVENTION (8 WEEKS). ALTHOUGH CHAIR YOGA WAS EFFECTIVE IN IMPROVING PHYSICAL FUNCTION AND REDUCING STIFFNESS IN OLDER ADULTS WITH OSTEOARTHRITIS, IT WAS NOT EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING PAIN LEVEL OR IMPROVING DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS. FUTURE RESEARCH PLANNED BY THIS TEAM WILL USE RIGOROUS STUDY METHODS, INCLUDING LARGER SAMPLES, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS, AND FOLLOW UP FOR MONITORING HOME PRACTICE AFTER THE INTERVENTIONS.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
6  130 32 A PRAGMATIC CONTROLLED TRIAL OF A BRIEF YOGA AND MINDFULNESS-BASED PROGRAM FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH IN EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS. OBJECTIVES: TO EXAMINE CHANGES IN PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL WELLBEING IN EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS THAT ATTENDED A BRIEF YOGA AND MINDFULNESS-BASED PROGRAM. DESIGN: PRAGMATIC CONTROLLED TRIAL COMPARING EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS THAT ATTENDED A YOGA MINDFULNESS-BASED PROGRAM (N = 9) TO A WAITLIST CONTROL GROUP (N = 22). SETTING: THE 3-DAY PROGRAM WAS DELIVERED AT THE KRIPALU CENTER FOR YOGA & HEALTH IN MASSACHUSETTS. INTERVENTION: THE 3-DAY YOGA MINDFULNESS PROGRAM INCLUDED 5 HOURS PER DAY OF YOGA, MINDFULNESS EXERCISES, FORMAL MEDITATION, DIDACTIC, AND EXPERIENTIAL ACTIVITIES. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: MEASURES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL WELLBEING WERE COMPLETED BEFORE (BASELINE), IMMEDIATELY AFTER (POST-PROGRAM), AND TWO MONTHS AFTER THE PROGRAM (FOLLOW-UP). RESULTS: RELATIVE TO CONTROLS (N = 21), THE RISE GROUP (N = 9) SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN POSITIVE AFFECT (P = .033), NEGATIVE AFFECT (P = .044), MINDFULNESS (P = .001), EMPOWERMENT (P = .022), SELF-COMPASSION (P = .001), AND WORK ENGAGEMENT FROM BASELINE TO POST-PROGRAM. FROM BASELINE TO FOLLOW-UP, THE RISE GROUP SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN STRESS (P = .008), NEGATIVE AFFECT (P = .013), MINDFULNESS (P = .001), EMPOWERMENT (P = .007), AND SELF-COMPASSION (P = .001) COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: THE YOGA MINDFULNESS PROGRAM WAS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVEMENTS IN EDUCATORS' PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL WELLBEING IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING AND 2-MONTHS FOLLOWING THE PROGRAM. FUTURE RESEARCH WITH A LARGER SAMPLE SIZE IS NEEDED TO CONFIRM THESE RESULTS.	2020

OLDER ADULTS ARE AN EXPONENTIALLY GROWING COHORT; EFFORTS TO IMPROVE THEIR HEALTH CAN ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO COMMUNITY HEALTH. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE CURRENT INTEGRATIVE REVIEW WAS TO EXAMINE QUANTITATIVE EVIDENCE CONCERNING EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS RELATED TO THE HEALTH OF COMMUNITY-DWELLING OLDER ADULTS. SIX STUDIES MET INCLUSION CRITERIA OF COMMUNITY-DWELLING OLDER ADULTS, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT) DESIGN, AND YOGA INTERVENTION IN THE PAST 10 YEARS. HATHA YOGA WAS MOST FREQUENTLY USED; INTERVENTIONS WERE WELL-RECEIVED WITH HIGH ADHERENCE RATES. BENEFITS FROM PARTICIPATION IN YOGA INCLUDED IMPROVEMENTS IN PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH, SUCH AS REDUCTIONS IN ANGER, ANXIETY, AND FEAR OF FALLING, AND INCREASES IN WELL-BEING, SELF-EFFICACY, IMPROVED EXECUTIVE AND IMMUNOLOGICAL FUNCTION, STRENGTH, AND BALANCE. FINDINGS REVEAL THAT ADDITIONAL WELL-DESIGNED YOGA RCTS ARE INDICATED WITH LONGER INTERVENTION AND FOLLOW UP TO ASSESS LIFESPAN CHANGES.

9 2062 33 THE BENEFITS OF YOGA IN THE CLASSROOM: A MIXED-METHODS APPROACH TO THE EFFECTS OF POSES AND BREATHING AND RELAXATION TECHNIQUES. BACKGROUND: DISADVANTAGED YOUTH IN THE UNITED STATES ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY LIKELY TO BE MORE SEDENTARY AND OBESE AND EXPERIENCE MORE STRESS THAN THEIR COUNTERPARTS WITH HIGHER SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS. YOGA AND BREATHING AND RELAXATION TECHNIQUES HAVE POSITIVE EFFECTS ON STRESS LEVELS, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY LEVELS, AND BEHAVIOR OF SCHOOL-AGED CHILDREN. AIMS: USING SOCIAL COGNITIVE THEORY TO EXAMINE BEHAVIORAL, PERSONAL, AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS, THE PURPOSE OF THIS PILOT STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE THE MULTILEVEL INFLUENCES OF A YOGA-BASED CLASSROOM INTERVENTION ON URBAN YOUTH. METHODS: USING A MIXED METHODOLOGICAL QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN, THIS PILOT STUDY INCLUDED THE THIRD GRADE STUDENTS (N = 40) AT ONE URBAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. A SURVEY CONTAINED STRESS, YOGA BEHAVIOR, AND AGGRESSION SCALES. IN ADDITION, INDIVIDUAL STUDENT INTERVIEWS, A TEACHER INTERVIEW, AND CLASSROOM OBSERVATIONS WERE CONDUCTED. RESULTS: PAIRED AND INDEPENDENT SAMPLE T-TESTS SHOWED PRE/POST DIFFERENCES IN YOGA PARTICIPATION BOTH IN AND OUT OF SCHOOL FOR THE INTERVENTION PARTICIPANTS (P < 0.01). QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS REVEALED THREE MAIN THEMES: (1) INCREASED USE AND ENJOYMENT OF YOGA TECHNIQUES, (2) BEHAVIORAL CHANGES BOTH IN/OUT OF SCHOOL, AND (3) IMPACT ON PERSONAL FACTORS. CONCLUSIONS: FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT URBAN CLASSROOMS SHOULD INCLUDE YOGA AND MINDFULNESS TRAINING AS IT CONTRIBUTES TO DAILY STUDENT PA AND ALSO CAN BE STRESS RELIEVING, FUN, CALMING, AND EASY TO PERFORM OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
10 1714 27 PERCEIVED HEALTH BENEFITS FROM YOGA AMONG BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS. PURPOSE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO DESCRIBE THE HEALTH BENEFITS REPORTED BY BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS FOLLOWING AN 8-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION. DESIGN: THIS PHENOMENOLOGICAL STUDY EMPLOYED THREE FOCUS GROUPS WITH SIX BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS EACH (N = 18) FOLLOWING THE YOGA INTERVENTION. SETTING: THE FOCUS GROUPS AND YOGA CLASSES WERE CONDUCTED IN A LARGE HOSPITAL IN A MIDSIZED TOWN IN THE MIDWEST. SUBJECTS: EIGHTEEN FEMALE BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS WHO WERE AT LEAST 9 MONTHS POSTTREATMENT PARTICIPATED IN THE FOCUS GROUPS FOLLOWING THE 8-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION. INTERVENTION: AN 8-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY FOR THIS POPULATION WAS LED BY A YOGA THERAPIST. MEASURES: A SEMISTRUCTURED INTERVIEW GUIDE WAS UTILIZED TO GUIDE EACH FOCUS GROUP. ANALYSIS: INTERPRETATIVE PHENOMENOLOGICAL ANALYSIS METHODS WERE EMPLOYED TO EXPLORE BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS' EXPERIENCES AFTER PARTICIPATING IN AN 8-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION. RESULTS: THE FINDINGS REVEALED THAT THE WOMEN IN THE STUDY FOUND HEALTH PROMOTING BENEFITS IN THE AREAS OF PHYSICAL HEALTH AND HEALING, MENTAL HEALTH AND HEALING, AND SOCIAL HEALTH AND HEALING. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA MAY BE AN IMPORTANT TOOL IN THE HEALING PROCESS FOR BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
11  955 31 EFFECTS OF A KUNDALINI YOGA PROGRAM ON ELEMENTARY AND MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS' STRESS, AFFECT, AND RESILIENCE. OBJECTIVE: THE YOUR OWN GREATNESS AFFIRMED (YOGA) FOR YOUTH PROGRAM DELIVERS YOGA TO URBAN INNER-CITY SCHOOLS WITH THE GOAL OF PROVIDING PRACTICAL BENEFITS THAT SUPPORT UNDERSERVED CHILDREN AT HIGH RISK OF BEHAVIORAL AND EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS. A 10-WEEK YOGA FOR YOUTH PROGRAM DELIVERED 1 TO 2 TIMES PER WEEK WAS IMPLEMENTED IN 3 SCHOOLS IN URBAN NEIGHBORHOODS TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF THE PROGRAM ON STUDENT STRESS, AFFECT, AND RESILIENCE. METHODS: THIRTY CHILDREN WERE ADMINISTERED THE PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE, THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE AFFECT SCHEDULE, AND THE RESILIENCE SCALE BEFORE AND AFTER THE YOGA PROGRAM. AFTER THE PROGRAM, INFORMAL QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED WITH SCHOOL TEACHERS, YOGA TEACHERS, AND STUDENTS TO DETERMINE THE OVERALL IMPACT OF THE YOGA PROGRAM. RESULTS: THE QUANTITATIVE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY INDICATED THAT THE YOGA PROGRAM SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED STUDENTS STRESS (P < 0.05), POSITIVE AFFECT (P < 0.05), AND RESILIENCE (P < 0.001). THE QUALITATIVE RESULTS INDICATED THAT STUDENTS, SCHOOL TEACHERS, AND YOGA TEACHERS ALL FOUND THE PROGRAM TO BE BENEFICIAL FOR STUDENTS' WELL-BEING. CONCLUSION: TAKEN TOGETHER, THESE DATA SUGGEST THAT THE YOGA FOR YOUTH PROGRAM MAY PROVIDE STUDENTS IN LOW-INCOME URBAN SCHOOLS WITH BEHAVIORAL SKILLS THAT WILL PROTECT AGAINST RISK FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF BEHAVIORAL AND EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
12  110 28 A PILOT STUDY MEASURING THE IMPACT OF YOGA ON THE TRAIT OF MINDFULNESS. BACKGROUND: THE CURRENT STUDY EXAMINED WHETHER YOGA WOULD INCREASE LEVELS OF MINDFULNESS IN A HEALTHY POPULATION. METHOD: FORTY-SIX PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO AN 8-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION GROUP OR A WAIT-LIST CONTROL GROUP. MINDFULNESS WAS ASSESSED PRE AND POST YOGA, USING THE FREIBURG MINDFULNESS INVENTORY (FMI). RESULTS: RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE YOGA GROUP EXPERIENCED A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN OVERALL MINDFULNESS, AND IN THREE MINDFULNESS SUBSCALES; ATTENTION TO THE PRESENT MOMENT, ACCEPTING AND OPEN ATTITUDES TOWARD EXPERIENCE, AND INSIGHTFUL UNDERSTANDING (P < .01). THE CONTROL GROUP EXPERIENCED A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN OVERALL MINDFULNESS (P < .02) AND INSIGHTFUL UNDERSTANDING (P < .01). FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT A YOGA INTERVENTION MAY BE A VIABLE METHOD FOR INCREASING LEVELS OF TRAIT MINDFULNESS IN A HEALTHY POPULATION, POTENTIALLY IMPLICATING YOGA AS A PREVENTIVE METHOD FOR THE LATER DEVELOPMENT OF NEGATIVE EMOTIONAL MOOD STATES (I.E. ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION). THE CONTROL GROUP ALSO EXPERIENCED MODERATE ELEVATIONS OF MINDFULNESS AT THE SECOND ASSESSMENT.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
13 2822 28 YOGA V. HEALTH EDUCATION FOR ATTENTIONAL PROCESSES RELEVANT TO MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER. OBJECTIVES: RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT YOGA MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE ADJUNCTIVE TREATMENT FOR PERSISTENT DEPRESSION, THE BENEFITS OF WHICH MAY ACCUMULATE OVER TIME. THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS STUDY WERE TO EVALUATE THE FOLLOWING IN A SAMPLE OF PERSISTENTLY DEPRESSED INDIVIDUALS: WHETHER YOGA INCREASES MINDFULNESS AND WHETHER YOGA ATTENUATES RUMINATION. RUMINATION AND MINDFULNESS BOTH REPRESENT ATTENTIONAL PROCESSES RELEVANT FOR ONSET AND MAINTENANCE OF DEPRESSIVE EPISODES. METHODS: ONE-HUNDRED-TEN INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE PERSISTENTLY DEPRESSED DESPITE ONGOING USE OF PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT WERE RECRUITED INTO AN RCT COMPARING YOGA WITH A HEALTH EDUCATION CLASS. MINDFULNESS AND RUMINATION WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE AND ACROSS 3 TIME POINTS DURING THE TEN-WEEK INTERVENTION. RESULTS: FINDINGS DEMONSTRATE THAT, COMPARED TO HEALTH EDUCATION, YOGA WAS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER MEAN LEVELS OF THE OBSERVE FACET OF MINDFULNESS RELATIVE TO THE CONTROL GROUP DURING THE INTERVENTION PERIOD (P =.004, D =0.38), AND THAT YOGA WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A FASTER RATE OF INCREASE IN LEVELS OF ACTING WITH AWARENESS OVER THE INTERVENTION PERIOD (P= .03, F(2) =0.027). THERE WERE NO DIFFERENCES BETWEEN INTERVENTION GROUPS WITH RESPECT TO RUMINATION. CONCLUSIONS: RESULTS SUGGEST A SMALL EFFECT OF YOGA ON COMPONENTS OF MINDFULNESS DURING A 10-WEEK INTERVENTION PERIOD. PREVIOUS RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT CONTINUED ASSESSMENT AFTER THE INITIAL 10 WEEKS MAY REVEAL CONTINUED IMPROVEMENT. FUTURE RESEARCH MAY ALSO EXAMINE MODERATORS OF THE IMPACT OF YOGA ON MINDFULNESS AND RUMINATION, INCLUDING CLINICAL FACTORS SUCH AS DEPRESSION SEVERITY OR DEPRESSION CHRONICITY, OR DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS SUCH AS AGE.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
14 1449 23 INFLUENCE OF HATHA YOGA ON PHYSICAL ACTIVITY CONSTRAINTS, PHYSICAL FITNESS, AND BODY IMAGE OF BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS: A PILOT STUDY. BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS OFTEN EXPERIENCE CHANGES IN THEIR PERCEPTION OF THEIR BODIES FOLLOWING SURGICAL TREATMENT. THESE CHANGES IN BODY IMAGE MAY INCREASE SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS AND PERCEPTIONS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY CONSTRAINTS AND REDUCE PARTICIPATION IN PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. WHILE THE NUMBER OF STUDIES EXAMINING DIFFERENT TYPES OF YOGA TARGETING WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER HAS INCREASED, STUDIES THUS FAR HAVE NOT STUDIED THE INFLUENCE THAT HATHA YOGA HAS ON BODY IMAGE AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY CONSTRAINTS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXPLORE THE CHANGES THAT OCCUR IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS IN TERMS OF BODY IMAGE, PERCEIVED CONSTRAINTS, AND PHYSICAL FITNESS FOLLOWING AN 8-WEEK HATHA YOGA INTERVENTION. THIS STUDY USED A NONRANDOMIZED TWO-GROUP PILOT STUDY, COMPARING AN 8-WEEK HATHA YOGA INTERVENTION WITH A LIGHT EXERCISE GROUP, BOTH DESIGNED FOR WOMEN WHO WERE AT LEAST NINE MONTHS POST-TREATMENT FOR BREAST CANCER. BOTH QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DATA WERE COLLECTED IN THE AREAS OF BODY IMAGE, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY CONSTRAINTS, AND PHYSICAL FITNESS. FINDINGS INDICATED THAT QUANTITATIVELY, YOGA PARTICIPANTS EXPERIENCED REDUCTIONS IN PHYSICAL ACTIVITY CONSTRAINTS AND IMPROVEMENTS IN LOWER- AND UPPER-BODY STRENGTH AND FLEXIBILITY, WHILE CONTROL PARTICIPANTS EXPERIENCED IMPROVEMENTS IN ABDOMINAL STRENGTH AND LOWER-BODY STRENGTH. QUALITATIVE FINDINGS SUPPORT CHANGES IN BODY IMAGE, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY CONSTRAINTS, AND PHYSICAL FITNESS FOR THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE YOGA GROUP. IN CONCLUSION, HATHA YOGA MAY REDUCE CONSTRAINTS TO PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND IMPROVE FITNESS IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS. MORE RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO EXPLORE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HATHA YOGA AND IMPROVEMENTS IN BODY IMAGE.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
15  280 18 ADHERENCE TO A YOGA PROGRAM IN OLDER WOMEN WITH KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS. YOGA IS BENEFICIAL FOR OSTEOARTHRITIS (OA) MANAGEMENT IN OLDER ADULTS; HOWEVER, ADHERENCE TO YOGA PRACTICE IS UNKNOWN. THE PURPOSES OF THIS SECONDARY ANALYSIS WERE TO EXAMINE: (1) YOGA ADHERENCE DURING THE INTERVENTION AND FOLLOW-UP PERIODS; (2) THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SOCIAL COGNITIVE THEORY (SCT) CONSTRUCTS AND ADHERENCE; AND (3) THE IMPACT OF ADHERENCE ON OA-RELATED SYMPTOMS IN 36 COMMUNITY-DWELLING OLDER WOMEN WITH KNEE OA. SCT WAS USED AS A FRAMEWORK TO PROMOTE ADHERENCE TO A YOGA INTERVENTION PROGRAM THAT INCLUDED BOTH GROUP/HOMEBASED PRACTICES. ADHERENCE TO YOGA WAS HIGH DURING THE INTERVENTION PERIOD BUT DECREASED OVER TIME. ALTHOUGH SCT WAS A USEFUL FRAMEWORK FOR REDUCING ATTRITION DURING THE INTERVENTION, SELF-EFFICACY WAS THE ONLY CONSTRUCT THAT CORRELATED WITH CLASS ATTENDANCE. HIGHER YOGA ADHERENCE WAS CORRELATED WITH IMPROVED SYMPTOMS, PHYSICAL FUNCTION, SLEEP QUALITY, AND QUALITY OF LIFE. YOGA ADHERERS WERE LIKELY TO BE OLDER, LESS EDUCATED, AND HAD A LOWER BODY MASS INDEX THAN NONADHERERS.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
16 1242 30 FEASIBILITY OF A YOGA INTERVENTION TO DECREASE PAIN IN OLDER WOMEN: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED PILOT STUDY. BACKGROUND: A SIGNIFICANT PROPORTION OF OLDER WOMEN SUFFER FROM CHRONIC PAIN, WHICH CAN DECREASE QUALITY OF LIFE. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PILOT RANDOMIZED STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY OF A FLOW-RESTORATIVE YOGA INTERVENTION DESIGNED TO DECREASE PAIN AND RELATED OUTCOMES AMONG WOMEN AGED 60 OR OLDER. METHODS: FLOW-RESTORATIVE YOGA CLASSES WERE HELD TWICE WEEKLY FOR 1 HOUR AND LED BY A CERTIFIED YOGA INSTRUCTOR. PARTICIPANTS RANDOMIZED TO THE INTERVENTION GROUP ATTENDED THE YOGA CLASSES FOR 12 WEEKS AND RECEIVED SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS FOR AT-HOME PRACTICE. THOSE RANDOMIZED TO THE CONTROL GROUP WERE ASKED TO MAINTAIN THEIR NORMAL DAILY ROUTINE. FEASIBILITY WAS EVALUATED USING RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION RATES, CLASS AND HOME PRACTICE ADHERENCE RATES, AND PARTICIPANT SATISFACTION SURVEYS. OUTCOME MEASURES (SELF-REPORTED PAIN, INFLAMMATORY MARKERS, FUNCTIONAL FITNESS, QUALITY OF LIFE, RESILIENCE, AND SELF-REPORTED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY) WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE AND POST-INTERVENTION. PAIRED T-TESTS OR WILCOXON SIGNED-RANK TESTS WERE USED TO EXAMINE CHANGES IN OUTCOME MEASURES WITHIN TREATMENT GROUPS. RESULTS: THIRTY-EIGHT PARTICIPANTS WERE RECRUITED AND RANDOMIZED. PARTICIPANTS WERE PRIMARILY WHITE, COLLEGE-EDUCATED, AND HIGHER FUNCTIONING, DESPITE EXPERIENCING VARIOUS FORMS OF CHRONIC PAIN. ATTENDANCE AND RETENTION RATES WERE HIGH (91 AND 97%, RESPECTIVELY) AND THE MAJORITY OF PARTICIPANTS WERE SATISFIED WITH THE YOGA PROGRAM (89%) AND WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO OTHERS (87%). INTERVENTION PARTICIPANTS ALSO EXPERIENCED REDUCTIONS IN PAIN INTERFERENCE AND IMPROVEMENTS IN ENERGY AND SOCIAL FUNCTIONING. CONCLUSIONS: THIS PILOT STUDY PROVIDES ESSENTIAL DATA TO INFORM A FULL SCALE RANDOMIZED TRIAL OF FLOW-RESTORATIVE YOGA FOR OLDER WOMEN WITH CHRONIC PAIN. FUTURE STUDIES SHOULD EMPHASIZE STRATEGIES TO RECRUIT A MORE DIVERSE STUDY POPULATION, PARTICULARLY OLDER WOMEN AT HIGHER RISK OF DISABILITY AND FUNCTIONAL DECLINE.

17 2837 29 YOGA'S IMPACT ON RISK AND PROTECTIVE FACTORS FOR DISORDERED EATING: A PILOT PREVENTION TRIAL. YOGA HAS BEEN PROPOSED AS A STRATEGY FOR IMPROVING RISK AND PROTECTIVE FACTORS FOR EATING DISORDERS, BUT FEW PREVENTION TRIALS HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PILOT STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OF A YOGA SERIES IN FEMALE COLLEGE STUDENTS (N = 52). PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO A YOGA INTERVENTION (THREE 50-MINUTE YOGA CLASSES/WEEK FOR 10 WEEKS CONDUCTED BY CERTIFIED YOGA TEACHERS WHO RECEIVED A 3-DAY INTENSIVE TRAINING) OR A CONTROL GROUP. RISK AND PROTECTIVE FACTORS, ASSESSED AT BASELINE, 5 AND 10 WEEKS, INCLUDED BODY DISSATISFACTION, NEGATIVE AFFECT, LONELINESS, SELF-COMPASSION, POSITIVE AFFECT, AND MINDFULNESS. MIXED MODELS CONTROLLING FOR BASELINE LEVELS OF OUTCOME VARIABLES WERE RUN. ON AVERAGE, PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED 20 OUT OF 30 YOGA CLASSES, AND THE MAJORITY OF PARTICIPANTS REPORTED HIGH LEVELS OF SATISFACTION WITH THE YOGA SERIES. APPEARANCE ORIENTATION DECREASED AND POSITIVE AFFECT INCREASED IN THE YOGA GROUP RELATIVE TO THE CONTROL GROUP. AFTER CONTROLLING FOR BASELINE LEVELS, THE YOGA GROUP HAD A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER POSITIVE AFFECT THAN THE CONTROL GROUP. CHANGES IN OTHER OUTCOMES WERE NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT, AS COMPARED TO THE CONTROL CONDITION. FUTURE YOGA RESEARCH DIRECTIONS ARE DISCUSSED INCLUDING EDUCATION ABOUT BODY IMAGE, MEASURE AND SAMPLE SELECTION, AND USE OF AN IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE FRAMEWORK.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
18 1958 24 SELF-MANAGEMENT AND YOGA FOR OLDER ADULTS WITH CHRONIC STROKE: A MIXED-METHODS STUDY OF PHYSICAL FITNESS AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED CHANGES IN PHYSICAL FITNESS AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AMONG OLDER PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC STROKE (STROKE >/= 6 MONTHS PREVIOUS) AFTER PARTICIPATION IN A YOGA INFUSED SELF-MANAGEMENT INTERVENTION. METHODS: A MIXED-METHODS SECONDARY DATA ANALYSIS EXAMINED QUANTITATIVE MEASURES OF ENDURANCE, STRENGTH, AND GAIT SPEED AND QUALITATIVE PERSPECTIVES OF INTERVENTION PARTICIPANTS. RESULTS: BASED ON WILCOXON ANALYSIS, PHYSICAL FITNESS OUTCOME MEASURES INCLUDING ENDURANCE AND LOWER AND UPPER BODY STRENGTH SIGNIFICANTLY (P < .02) IMPROVED. BASED ON QUALITATIVE RESULTS OF 2 FOCUS GROUPS AND 14 INDIVIDUAL INTERVIEWS, PARTICIPANTS EXPRESSED POSITIVE CHANGES IN ENDURANCE, STRENGTH, GAIT SPEED, FLEXIBILITY, AND BALANCE. THEY ALSO REPORTED IMPROVEMENTS IN WALKING ABILITY AND DURATION, AND EXPRESSED A DESIRE TO CONTINUE YOGA AND INCREASE LEVELS OF EXERCISE. CONCLUSIONS: WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF IMPROVING PHYSICAL FITNESS AND EXERCISE FOR OLDER ADULTS WITH CHRONIC STROKE, IT IS IMPORTANT FOR SELF-MANAGEMENT INTERVENTIONS TO PROVIDE SPECIFIC SAFE AND FEASIBLE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY COMPONENTS, SUCH AS YOGA. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: HEALTH PROFESSIONALS MAY IMPROVE OFFERED CHRONIC STROKE SELF-MANAGEMENT INTERVENTIONS BY INCORPORATING YOGA.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
19   13 28 "MORE THAN I EXPECTED": PERCEIVED BENEFITS OF YOGA PRACTICE AMONG OLDER ADULTS AT RISK FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED WITH PARTICIPANTS FROM TRIALS EXAMINING THE EFFECTS OF AN IYENGAR YOGA PROGRAM ON CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE RISK. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE CURRENT STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE PERCEIVED BENEFITS OF YOGA IN A POPULATION OF OLDER, PREDOMINANTLY OVERWEIGHT ADULTS PARTICIPATING IN A GENTLE 8-WEEK YOGA PROGRAM. DESIGN: THIS STUDY USED A CONSTRUCTIVIST-INTERPRETIVE APPROACH TO NATURALISTIC INQUIRY. SETTING: A TOTAL OF 42 PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THE INTERVENTION AND MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR THE CURRENT QUALITATIVE STUDY. INTERVENTION: THE 8-WEEK IYENGAR YOGA PROGRAM INCLUDED TWO 90-MIN YOGA CLASSES AND FIVE 30-MIN HOME SESSIONS PER WEEK. PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED WEEKLY LOGS AND AN EXIT QUESTIONNAIRE AT THE END OF THE STUDY. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: QUALITATIVE DATA FROM WEEKLY LOGS AND EXIT QUESTIONNAIRES WERE COMPILED AND CONVENTIONAL CONTENT ANALYSIS PERFORMED WITH THE USE OF ATLAS.TI TO FACILITATE THE PROCESS. RESULTS: FOUR BROAD THEMES EMERGED FROM CONTENT ANALYSIS: PRACTICING YOGA IMPROVED OVERALL PHYSICAL FUNCTION AND CAPACITY (FOR 83% OF PARTICIPANTS); PRACTICING YOGA REDUCED STRESS/ANXIETY AND ENHANCED CALMNESS (83% OF PARTICIPANTS); PRACTICING YOGA ENRICHED THE QUALITY OF SLEEP (21% OF PARTICIPANTS); AND PRACTICING YOGA SUPPORTED EFFORTS TOWARD DIETARY IMPROVEMENTS (14% OF PARTICIPANTS). CONCLUSIONS: THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT YOGA MAY HAVE ANCILLARY BENEFITS IN TERMS OF IMPROVED PHYSICAL FUNCTION, ENHANCED MENTAL/EMOTIONAL STATE, ENRICHED SLEEP QUALITY, AND IMPROVED LIFESTYLE CHOICES, AND MAY BE USEFUL AS A HEALTH PROMOTION STRATEGY IN THE PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC DISEASE.	2013

1 1748 152 PILOT RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIAL OF A DYADIC YOGA PROGRAM FOR GLIOMA PATIENTS UNDERGOING RADIOTHERAPY AND THEIR FAMILY CAREGIVERS. BACKGROUND: WHILE THE USE OF BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE IN MANAGING GLIOMA PATIENTS' SYMPTOMS IS NOT WELL STUDIED, THE HIGH SYMPTOM BURDEN IN PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILY CAREGIVERS IS WELL ESTABLISHED. WE CONDUCTED A PILOT RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIAL TO EXAMINE THE FEASIBILITY AND PRELIMINARY EFFICACY OF A DYADIC YOGA (DY) INTERVENTION AS A SUPPORTIVE CARE STRATEGY. METHODS: GLIOMA PATIENTS UNDERGOING RADIOTHERAPY AND THEIR CAREGIVERS WERE RANDOMIZED TO A 12-SESSION DY OR WAITLIST CONTROL (WLC) GROUP. PRIOR TO RADIOTHERAPY AND RANDOMIZATION, BOTH GROUPS COMPLETED MEASURES OF CANCER-RELATED SYMPTOMS (MD ANDERSON SYMPTOM INVENTORY-BRAIN TUMOR MODULE), DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS (CENTER FOR EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES-DEPRESSION MEASURE), FATIGUE (BRIEF FATIGUE INVENTORY), AND OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL; MEDICAL OUTCOMES STUDY 36-ITEM SHORT-FORM SURVEY). DYADS WERE REASSESSED AT THE LAST DAY OF RADIOTHERAPY. RESULTS: TWENTY PATIENTS (MEAN AGE: 46 YEARS, 50% FEMALE, 80% WHO GRADE IV AND CAREGIVERS (MEAN AGE: 50 YEARS, 70% FEMALE, 50% SPOUSES) PARTICIPATED IN THE TRIAL. A PRIORI FEASIBILITY CRITERIA WERE MET REGARDING CONSENT (70%), ADHERENCE (88%), AND RETENTION (95%) RATES. CONTROLLING FOR RELEVANT COVARIATES, CHANGE SCORE ANALYSES REVEALED CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS FOR PATIENTS IN THE DY COMPARED WITH THE WLC GROUP FOR OVERALL CANCER SYMPTOM SEVERITY (D = 0.96) AND SYMPTOM INTERFERENCE (D = 0.74), DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS (D = 0.71), AND MENTAL QOL (D = 0.69). CAREGIVERS IN THE DY GROUP REPORTED CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS (D = 1.12), FATIGUE (D = 0.89), AND MENTAL QOL (D = 0.49) RELATIVE TO THOSE IN THE WLC GROUP. CONCLUSION: A DY INTERVENTION APPEARS TO BE A FEASIBLE AND BENEFICIAL SYMPTOM AND QOL MANAGEMENT STRATEGY FOR GLIOMA PATIENTS UNDERGOING RADIOTHERAPY AND THEIR CAREGIVERS. AN EFFICACY TRIAL WITH A MORE STRINGENT CONTROL GROUP IS WARRANTED.

2  648  84 DYADIC YOGA PROGRAM FOR PATIENTS UNDERGOING THORACIC RADIOTHERAPY AND THEIR FAMILY CAREGIVERS: RESULTS OF A PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: THORACIC RADIOTHERAPY (TRT) MAY RESULT IN TOXICITIES THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH PERFORMANCE DECLINES AND POOR QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) FOR PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILY CAREGIVERS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL WAS TO ESTABLISH FEASIBILITY AND PRELIMINARY EFFICACY OF A DYADIC YOGA (DY) INTERVENTION AS A SUPPORTIVE CARE STRATEGY. METHODS: PATIENTS WITH STAGE I TO III NON-SMALL CELL LUNG OR ESOPHAGEAL CANCER UNDERGOING TRT AND THEIR CAREGIVERS (N = 26 DYADS) WERE RANDOMIZED TO A 15-SESSION DY OR A WAITLIST CONTROL (WLC) GROUP. PRIOR TO TRT AND RANDOMIZATION, BOTH GROUPS COMPLETED MEASURES OF QOL (SF-36) AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS (CES-D). PATIENTS ALSO COMPLETED THE 6-MINUTE WALK TEST (6MWT). DYADS WERE REASSESSED ON THE LAST DAY OF TRT AND 3 MONTHS LATER. RESULTS: A PRIORI FEASIBILITY CRITERIA WERE MET REGARDING CONSENT (68%), ADHERENCE (80%), AND RETENTION (81%) RATES. CONTROLLING FOR RELEVANT COVARIATES, MULTILEVEL MODELING ANALYSES REVEALED SIGNIFICANT CLINICAL IMPROVEMENTS FOR PATIENTS IN THE DY GROUP COMPARED WITH THE WLC GROUP FOR THE 6MWT (MEANS: DY = 473 M VS WLC = 397 M, D = 1.19) AND SF-36 PHYSICAL FUNCTION (MEANS: DY = 38.77 VS WLC = 30.88; D = .66) AND SOCIAL FUNCTION (MEANS: DY = 45.24 VS WLC = 39.09; D = .44) ACROSS THE FOLLOW-UP PERIOD. CAREGIVERS IN THE DY GROUP REPORTED MARGINALLY CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN SF-36 VITALITY (MEANS: DY = 53.05 VS WLC = 48.84; D = .39) AND ROLE PERFORMANCE (MEANS: DY = 52.78 VS WLC = 48.59; D = .51) RELATIVE TO THOSE IN THE WLC GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: THIS NOVEL SUPPORTIVE CARE PROGRAM APPEARS TO BE FEASIBLE AND BENEFICIAL FOR PATIENTS UNDERGOING TRT AND THEIR CAREGIVERS. A LARGER EFFICACY TRIAL WITH A MORE STRINGENT CONTROL GROUP IS WARRANTED.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
3  199  57 A RESEARCH PROTOCOL FOR A PILOT, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL DESIGNED TO EXAMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF A DYADIC VERSUS INDIVIDUAL YOGA PROGRAM FOR FAMILY CAREGIVERS OF GLIOMA PATIENTS UNDERGOING RADIOTHERAPY. BACKGROUND: ALTHOUGH THE DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF A PRIMARY BRAIN TUMOR PRESENT UNIQUE CHALLENGES TO PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILY CAREGIVERS, EVIDENCE-BASED SUPPORTIVE CARE INTERVENTIONS ARE GENERALLY LACKING. THE PRIMARY AIM OF THIS RESEARCH PROTOCOL IS TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF IMPLEMENTING A DYADIC YOGA (DY) VERSUS A CAREGIVER YOGA (CY) INTERVENTION OR A WAIT-LIST CONTROL (WLC) GROUP USING A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL DESIGN. METHODS: SEVENTY-FIVE GLIOMA PATIENTS UNDERGOING RADIOTHERAPY AND THEIR FAMILY CAREGIVERS ARE RANDOMIZED TO THE DY, CY, OR A WLC GROUP. PATIENT-CAREGIVER DYADS IN THE DY GROUP AND CAREGIVERS IN THE CY GROUP RECEIVE 15 SESSIONS (45 MIN EACH) OVER THE COURSE OF PATIENTS' STANDARD RADIOTHERAPY (6 WEEKS). PATIENTS AND CAREGIVERS IN ALL GROUPS COMPLETE BASELINE ASSESSMENTS OF SYMPTOMS, QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL), AND HEALTH UTILIZATION OUTCOMES PRIOR TO RANDOMIZATION. FOLLOW-UP ASSESSMENTS ARE PERFORMED 6 WEEKS AND THEN AGAIN 3 MONTHS LATER. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME IS FEASIBILITY (I.E., >/= 50% OF ELIGIBLE DYADS CONSENT, >/= 70% OF ENROLLED DYADS COMPLETE ALL ASSESSMENTS, AND >/= 50% OF ALL PRACTICE SESSIONS ARE ATTENDED). WE WILL ALSO PERFORM PRIMARILY DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSES OF THE SELF-REPORTED OUTCOMES (E.G., FATIGUE, OVERALL QOL) AND EXPLORE POTENTIAL INTERVENTION MODERATORS (E.G., PERFORMANCE STATUS) TO INFORM A LARGER FUTURE TRIAL. CONCLUSION: THIS TRIAL WILL PROVIDE IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING THE FEASIBILITY OF A DYADIC VERSUS A CAREGIVER YOGA INTERVENTION REGARDING SYMPTOM, QOL, AND HEALTH UTILIZATION OUTCOMES IN GLIOMA PATIENTS AND THEIR CAREGIVERS.

4 2762  75 YOGA PROGRAM FOR HIGH-GRADE GLIOMA PATIENTS UNDERGOING RADIOTHERAPY AND THEIR FAMILY CAREGIVERS. BACKGROUND: DESPITE THEIR HIGH SYMPTOM BURDEN AND POOR PROGNOSIS, EVIDENCE-BASED SUPPORTIVE CARE INTERVENTIONS FOR ADULTS WITH HIGH-GRADE GLIOMA (HGG) AND THEIR CAREGIVERS ARE LACKING. THUS, WE AIMED TO ESTABLISH FEASIBILITY OF A PATIENT-CAREGIVER DYADIC YOGA PROGRAM (DYP) FOR NEWLY DIAGNOSED HGG PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILY CAREGIVERS TARGETING QUALITY-OF-LIFE (QOL) OUTCOMES. METHOD: IN THIS SINGLE-ARM PILOT TRIAL, DYADS PARTICIPATED IN A 12-SESSION DYP PROGRAM ACROSS THE COURSE OF PATIENTS' RADIOTHERAPY. THE INTERVENTION FOCUSED ON BREATHING EXERCISES, GENTLE MOVEMENTS, AND GUIDED MEDITATIONS. WE TRACKED FEASIBILITY DATA AND ASSESSED LEVELS OF CANCER-RELATED SYMPTOMS (MD ANDERSON SYMPTOM INVENTORY [MDASI]), DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS (CENTERS FOR EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES-DEPRESSION SCALE), FATIGUE (BRIEF FATIGUE INVENTORY), SLEEP DISTURBANCES (PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX [PSQI]), AND OVERALL MENTAL AND PHYSICAL QOL (36-ITEM SHORT-FORM SURVEY [SF-36]) AT BASELINE AND POST-DYP, WHICH WAS AT THE END OF RADIOTHERAPY. RESULTS: WE APPROACHED 6 DYADS OF WHICH 5 DYADS (86%) CONSENTED AND COMPLETED ALL 12 SESSIONS AND PRE/POST ASSESSMENTS. ALL PATIENTS (MEAN AGE: 52 YEARS, 80% FEMALE, 80% GRADE IV) AND CAREGIVERS (MEAN AGE: 58 YEARS, 80% FEMALE, 60% SPOUSES) PERCEIVED BENEFIT FROM THE PROGRAM. PAIRED T TESTS REVEALED A MARGINALLY SIGNIFICANT, YET CLINICALLY MEANINGFUL, DECREASE IN PATIENT'S CANCER SYMPTOMS ( T = 2.32, P = .08; MDASI MEAN; PRE = 1.75, POST = 1.04). THERE WERE CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN PATIENT SLEEP DISTURBANCES (PSQI MEAN: PRE = 10.75, POST = 8.00) AND IMPROVEMENTS IN PATIENT AND CAREGIVER MENTAL QOL (MCS OF SF-36 MEAN: PRE = 42.35, POST = 52.34, AND PRE = 45.14, POST = 51.43, RESPECTIVELY). CONCLUSIONS: THIS NOVEL SUPPORTIVE CARE PROGRAM APPEARS TO BE SAFE, FEASIBLE, ACCEPTABLE, AND SUBJECTIVELY USEFUL FOR HGG PATIENTS AND THEIR CAREGIVERS. THERE WAS ALSO PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE REGARDING QOL TREATMENT GAINS FOR BOTH PATIENTS AND CAREGIVERS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
5 2361  57 VIVEKANANDA YOGA PROGRAM FOR PATIENTS WITH ADVANCED LUNG CANCER AND THEIR FAMILY CAREGIVERS. BACKGROUND: THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ESTABLISH THE FEASIBILITY OF A COUPLE-BASED VIVEKANANDA YOGA (VKC) INTERVENTION IN LUNG CANCER PATIENTS AND CAREGIVERS. SECONDLY, WE EXAMINED PRELIMINARY EFFICACY REGARDING QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) OUTCOMES. METHOD: IN THIS SINGLE-ARM FEASIBILITY TRIAL, PATIENTS WITH LUNG CANCER UNDERGOING RADIOTHERAPY AND THEIR CAREGIVERS PARTICIPATED IN A 15-SESSION VKC PROGRAM THAT FOCUSED ON THE INTERCONNECTEDNESS OF THE DYAD. WE ASSESSED PRE-AND POST-INTERVENTION LEVELS OF FATIGUE, SLEEP DISTURBANCES, PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS, OVERALL QOL, SPIRITUALITY, AND RELATIONAL CLOSENESS. WE TRACKED FEASIBILITY DATA, AND PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED PROGRAM EVALUATIONS. RESULTS: WE APPROACHED 28 ELIGIBLE DYADS OF WHICH 15 (53%) CONSENTED AND 9 (60%) COMPLETED THE INTERVENTION. PATIENTS (MEAN AGE = 73 YEARS, 63% FEMALE, ALL STAGE III) AND CAREGIVERS (MEAN AGE = 62 YEARS, 38% FEMALE, 63% SPOUSES) COMPLETED A MEAN OF 10 SESSIONS AND 95.5% OF THEM RATED THE PROGRAM AS VERY USEFUL. PAIRED T TESTS REVEALED A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN PATIENTS' MENTAL HEALTH (D = 0.84; P = .04) AND A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN CAREGIVERS' SLEEP DISTURBANCES (D = 1.44; P = .02). ALTHOUGH NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT, FOR PATIENTS, EFFECT SIZES FOR CHANGE SCORES WERE MEDIUM FOR BENEFIT FINDING AND SMALL FOR DISTRESS (D = 0.65 AND 0.37, RESPECTIVELY). FOR CAREGIVERS, MEDIUM EFFECTS WERE FOUND FOR IMPROVEMENT IN PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING (D = 0.50). CONCLUSION: THIS NOVEL SUPPORTIVE CARE PROGRAM APPEARS TO BE SAFE, FEASIBLE, ACCEPTABLE, AND SUBJECTIVELY USEFUL FOR LUNG CANCER PATIENTS AND THEIR CAREGIVERS AND LENDS SUPPORT FOR FURTHER STUDY.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
6  114  27 A PILOT STUDY OF A YOGA AND MEDITATION INTERVENTION FOR DEMENTIA CAREGIVER STRESS. TWELVE OLDER FEMALE DEMENTIA PATIENT FAMILY CAREGIVERS (EIGHT LATINAS AND FOUR CAUCASIANS) PARTICIPATED IN A SIX-SESSION MANUALIZED YOGA-MEDITATION PROGRAM (CALLED INNER RESOURCES) DESIGNED TO HELP CAREGIVERS COPE WITH STRESS. PRE/POST COMPARISONS REVEALED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY AND IMPROVEMENTS IN PERCEIVED SELF-EFFICACY. AVERAGE MINUTES OF WEEKLY YOGA-MEDITATION PRACTICE WERE SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVEMENTS IN DEPRESSION. THE MAJORITY OF CAREGIVERS FOUND THE INTERVENTION USEFUL AND REPORTED SUBJECTIVE IMPROVEMENTS IN PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL FUNCTIONING. THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT INNER RESOURCES MAY BE A FEASIBLE AND EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION FOR FAMILY CAREGIVERS AND MAY IMPROVE AFFECT, COPING, PHYSICAL WELL-BEING, AND STRESS MANAGEMENT.	2004

THIS STUDY AIMED TO EMPOWER CAREGIVERS TO COPE EFFECTIVELY WITH PD AND MAINTAIN WELL-BEING BY PRACTICING YOGA. MATERIALS AND METHODS A TOTAL OF 34 CAREGIVERS WERE RANDOMIZED TO THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP (EG) AND WAITLISTED CONTROL GROUP IN A MULTIPHASE MANNER. DATA WERE COLLECTED USING SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC SCHEDULE, KESSLER'S PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS SCALE-10, AND WARWICK-EDINBURGH'S MENTAL WELL-BEING SCALE. CAREGIVERS' YOGA MODULE (CYM) CONSISTING OF SATSANGA (THEORY), ASANAS (POSTURES), PRANAYAMA (BREATH CONTROL), IMAGERY, MEDITATION, AND RELAXATION TECHNIQUES WAS TAUGHT TO THOSE IN THE EG AT 35 M/D FOR EIGHT CONSECUTIVE DAYS. THEY WERE ENCOURAGED TO CONTINUE ON THEIR OWN FOR ANOTHER 3 WEEKS. POSTTEST DATA WERE COLLECTED FROM BOTH GROUPS ON THE 15TH AND 29TH DAYS. ANALYSIS WAS DONE WITH IBM SPSS STATISTICS VERSION 22 (IBM CORP., ARMONK, NEW YORK, UNITED STATES). RESULTS THERE WAS STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION OF PD AND IMPROVEMENT OF MWB AMONG CAREGIVERS OF EG WITHIN (PD: F = 17.78, P < 0.001; MWB: F = 5.48, P < 0.03) AND BETWEEN (PD: F = 15.87, P < 0.001; MWB: F = 15.87, P < 0.01) THE GROUPS AFTER THE CYM. A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE CORRELATION WAS FOUND BETWEEN PRETEST MWB AND PD ( R =-0.579, P < 0.01). CAREGIVERS WHO WERE MARRIED AND CAREGIVERS' PERCEPTION OF POOR IMPROVEMENT OF PATIENT CONDITION WERE SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH PD. CONCLUSION FINDINGS PROVIDE PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE FOR THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CYM ON PD AND MWB AMONG CAREGIVERS OF PATIENTS ADMITTED TO NEUROREHABILITATION WARDS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
9 2233  35 THE IMPACT OF YOGA ON QUALITY OF LIFE AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS IN CAREGIVERS FOR PATIENTS WITH CANCER. PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF A SIX-WEEK VINYASA YOGA (VY) INTERVENTION ON CAREGIVERS' OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS. DESIGN: A SINGLE-GROUP, PRE- AND POST-TEST PILOT STUDY. SETTING: UNIVERSITY PUBLIC RECREATIONAL FACILITY. SAMPLE: 12 INFORMAL CAREGIVERS FOR PATIENTS WITH CANCER. METHODS: CAREGIVERS PARTICIPATED IN A SIX-WEEK VY INTERVENTION AND COMPLETED MEASURES OF QOL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS PRE- AND POSTINTERVENTION. PROGRAM SATISFACTION WAS MEASURED WITH OPEN-ENDED SURVEY QUESTIONS. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: QOL, PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS, AND PROGRAM SATISFACTION. FINDINGS: SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WERE FOUND IN THE MENTAL COMPONENT SCORE OF OVERALL QOL AND IN OVERALL PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS. SEVERAL SUBDOMAINS OF QOL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS WERE ALSO IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY. OPEN-ENDED SURVEY QUESTION RESPONSES REVEALED PARTICIPANTS PERCEIVED PHYSICAL AND MENTAL BENEFIT FROM THE INTERVENTION, HIGHLIGHTING IMPROVEMENTS IN FLEXIBILITY, CORE AND UPPER-BODY STRENGTH, BALANCE, BREATHING, AND ENERGY. CONCLUSIONS: INFORMAL CAREGIVERS MAY BENEFIT MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY FROM PARTICIPATING IN VY. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: CAREGIVERS OF PATIENTS WITH CANCER CHARACTERIZE A GROUP WORTHY OF ATTENTION, RESEARCH, AND INTERVENTIONS FOCUSING ON THEIR HEALTHCARE NEEDS.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
10  599  43 DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF AN AUDIO-VISUAL SELF-HELP YOGA MANUAL FOR INDIAN CAREGIVERS OF PERSONS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA LIVING IN THE COMMUNITY: A SINGLE-BLIND RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: TO TEST THE FEASIBILITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF AN AUDIO-VISUAL SELF-HELP AUDIO-VISUAL YOGA MANUAL ON BURDEN OF INDIAN CAREGIVERS OF PERSONS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA, LIVING IN THE COMMUNITY. METHODS: AN EARLIER DEVELOPED YOGA PROGRAM FOR CAREGIVERS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA WAS REMODELED INTO AN AUDIO-VISUAL SELF-HELP MANUAL IN THREE LANGUAGES AND VALIDATED BY MENTAL HEALTH AND YOGA EXPERTS. 48 CONSENTING PRIMARY FAMILY CAREGIVERS OF OUTPATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA WERE SCREENED, RECRUITED, AND ALLOTTED RANDOMLY TO YOGA OR CARE AS USUAL GROUP. PARTICIPANTS IN YOGA GROUP WERE TAUGHT YOGA FROM THE SELF-HELP MANUAL (1 SESSION OF 1 H EVERY MONTH FOR 5 MONTHS). THE CAREGIVERS WERE ASKED TO FOLLOW THE MANUAL FOR THE REMAINING MONTH AT HOME. ASSESSMENTS OF BURDEN, PERCEIVED STRESS, QUALITY OF LIFE, AND ANXIETY-DEPRESSION WERE CONDUCTED BY A RATER BLIND TO THE GROUP STATUS AT BASELINE AND AT THE END OF EVERY MONTH. RESULTS: POST FACTORING FOR MISSING DATA, REPEATEDMEASURE ANOVA WAS CONDUCTED; WHICH SHOWED THAT THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE GROUP THAT PRACTICED THE SELFHELP YOGA MANUAL AND THE CARE AS USUAL GROUP. THE CAREGIVERS WHO PRACTICED YOGA AT HOME MAINTAINED AN AVERAGE OF 50% ATTENDANCE AND "VERY WELL" LEVEL OF YOGA PERFORMANCE. CONCLUSION: THE AUDIO-VISUAL SELF-HELP YOGA MANUAL WAS FOUND TO BE FEASIBLE TO USE BY THE CAREGIVERS EVEN THOUGH ITS EFFECTIVENESS COULD NOT BE ASCERTAINED DUE TO HIGH ATTRITION.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
11 2360  38 VIDEOCONFERENCED YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR CANCER PATIENTS AND THEIR CAREGIVERS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC: A REPORT FROM A CLINICIAN'S PERSPECTIVE. BACKGROUND: THE ACCEPTABILITY OF VIDEOCONFERENCING DELIVERY OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS IN THE ADVANCED CANCER SETTING IS RELATIVELY UNEXPLORED. THE CURRENT REPORT SUMMARIZES THE CHALLENGES AND SOLUTIONS OF THE TRANSITION FROM AN IN-PERSON (IE, FACE-TO-FACE) TO A VIDEOCONFERENCE INTERVENTION DELIVERY APPROACH IN RESPONSE TO THE CORONAVIRUS DISEASE PANDEMIC. METHOD: PARTICIPANTS INCLUDED PATIENT-FAMILY CAREGIVER DYADS WHO WERE ENROLLED IN ONGOING YOGA TRIALS AND 2 CERTIFIED YOGA THERAPISTS WHO DELIVERED THE YOGA SESSIONS. WE SUMMARIZED THEIR EXPERIENCES USING RECORDINGS OF THE YOGA SESSIONS AND INTERVENTIONISTS' PROGRESS NOTES. RESULTS: OUT OF 7 DYADS PARTICIPATING IN THE PARENT TRIAL, 1 DECLINED THE VIDEOCONFERENCED SESSIONS. PARTICIPANTS WERE BETWEEN THE AGES OF 55 AND 76 AND MOSTLY NON-HISPANIC WHITE (83%). PATIENTS WERE MAINLY MALE (83%), ALL HAD STAGE III OR IV CANCER AND WERE UNDERGOING RADIOTHERAPY. CAREGIVERS WERE ALL FEMALE. DESPITE CHALLENGES IN THE AREAS OF TECHNOLOGY, LOCATION, AND SETTING, INSTRUCTION AND PERSONAL CONNECTION, THE OVERALL ACCEPTABILITY WAS HIGH AMONG PATIENTS, CAREGIVERS, AND INSTRUCTORS. THROUGH THIS TRANSITION PROCESS, SOLUTIONS TO THESE CHALLENGES WERE FOUND, WHICH ARE DESCRIBED HERE. CONCLUSION: ALTHOUGH IN-PERSON INTERVENTIONS ARE FAVORED BY BOTH THE STUDY PARTICIPANTS AND THE INTERVENTIONISTS, VIDEOCONFERENCE SESSIONS WERE DEEMED ACCEPTABLE. ALL PARTICIPANTS HAD THE BENEFIT OF A PREVIOUS IN-PERSON EXPERIENCE, WHICH WAS HELPFUL AND PERHAPS NECESSARY FOR OLDER AND ADVANCED CANCER PATIENTS REQUIRING PRACTICE MODIFICATIONS. IN A REMOTE SETTING, THE ASSISTANCE OF CAREGIVERS SEEMS PARTICULARLY BENEFICIAL TO ENSURE PRACTICE SAFETY.

12  101  37 A PHASE I FEASIBILITY STUDY OF YOGA ON THE PHYSICAL HEALTH AND COPING OF INFORMAL CAREGIVERS. FAMILY AND FRIENDS WHO PROVIDE UNPAID CARE TO AN INDIVIDUAL WITH A DISEASE OR DISABILITY (KNOWN AS INFORMAL CAREGIVERS) EXPERIENCE NUMEROUS THREATS TO THEIR PHYSICAL HEALTH AS A RESULT OF PROVIDING CARE. IN SPITE OF EVIDENCE THAT PARTICIPATION IN PHYSICAL AND LEISURE ACTIVITIES CAN BE HEALTH PROMOTING, INFORMAL CAREGIVERS HAVE REPORTED DIMINISHED OR COMPLETELY ABSENT LEISURE PARTICIPATION. HATHA YOGA HAS DOCUMENTED THERAPEUTIC BENEFITS, INCLUDING REDUCED ANXIETY, AS WELL AS IMPROVED MUSCLE STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE AND FLEXIBILITY. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF CONDUCTING AN 8-WEEK YOGA PROGRAM WITH INFORMAL CAREGIVERS, AND TO GATHER PILOT DATA ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON THE PHYSICAL FITNESS AND COPING OF INFORMAL CAREGIVERS. CAREGIVERS WERE RANDOMIZED INTO A YOGA INTERVENTION (N = 8) OR CONTROL GROUP (N = 9). THE YOGA SESSIONS WERE 2.5 HOURS/WEEK FOR 8 WEEKS AND CONSISTED OF A VARIETY OF PRANAYAMA (BREATHING) AND ASANA (POSTURES) ACTIVITIES AND WERE LED BY A CERTIFIED YOGA INSTRUCTOR. FOUR CAREGIVERS (TWO IN EACH GROUP) DROPPED OUT OF THE STUDY. AFTER THE CONCLUSION OF THE 8-WEEK YOGA PROGRAM, LOWER BODY STRENGTH INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY FOR THOSE IN THE YOGA GROUP AND OTHER NOTABLE TRENDS OCCURRED IN TERMS OF COPING, UPPER BODY STRENGTH AND AEROBIC ENDURANCE. CAREGIVERS IN THE CONTROL GROUP EXPERIENCED AN UNEXPECTED INCREASE IN LOWER BODY FLEXIBILITY. THESE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT CAREGIVERS IN A YOGA PROGRAM MAY RECEIVE SOME BENEFITS. FUTURE STUDIES ARE ENCOURAGED TO TEST THE EFFICACY OF YOGA AS AN INTERVENTION FOR CAREGIVERS.	2007	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
13  595  25 DEVELOPMENT AND FEASIBILITY OF NEED-BASED YOGA PROGRAM FOR FAMILY CAREGIVERS OF IN-PATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA IN INDIA. CONTEXT AND AIM: YOGA HAS BEEN FOUND TO BE EFFECTIVE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF STRESS. THIS PAPER DESCRIBES THE DEVELOPMENT OF A YOGA PROGRAM AIMED TO REDUCE BURDEN AND IMPROVE COPING OF FAMILY CAREGIVERS OF INPATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA IN INDIA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: BASED ON THE ASSESSMENT OF CAREGIVER NEEDS, LITERATURE REVIEW, AND EXPERT OPINION, A TEN-DAY GROUP YOGA PROGRAM WAS INITIALLY DEVELOPED USING THE QUALITATIVE INDUCTIVE METHOD OF INQUIRY. EACH DAY'S PROGRAM INCLUDED WARM-UP EXERCISES, YOGIC ASANAS, PRANAYAMA, AND SATSANG. A STRUCTURED QUESTIONNAIRE ELICITING COMMENTS ON EACH DAY'S CONTENTS WAS GIVEN INDEPENDENTLY TO TEN EXPERIENCED YOGA PROFESSIONALS WORKING IN THE FIELD OF HEALTH FOR VALIDATION. THE FINAL VERSION OF THE PROGRAM WAS PILOT-TESTED ON A GROUP OF SIX CAREGIVERS OF IN-PATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA ADMITTED AT NIMHANS, BANGALORE. RESULTS: ON THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THE PROGRAM WOULD HELP REDUCE THE BURDEN OF CAREGIVERS, SIX OF THE TEN EXPERTS (60%) GAVE A RANK OF FOUR OF FIVE (VERY MUCH USEFUL). BASED ON COMMENTS OF THE EXPERTS, SEVERAL CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE PROGRAM. IN THE PILOT-TESTING STAGE, MORE THAN 60% OF THE CAREGIVERS ASSIGNED A SCORE OF FOUR AND ABOVE (ON A FIVE-POINT LIKERT SCALE, FIVE BEING EXTREMELY USEFUL) FOR THE OVERALL PROGRAM, HANDOUTS DISTRIBUTED, AND PERFORMANCE OF THE TRAINER. QUALITATIVE FEEDBACK OF THE CAREGIVERS FURTHER ENDORSED THE FEASIBILITY AND USEFULNESS OF THE PROGRAM. CONCLUSION: THE DEVELOPED YOGA PROGRAM WAS FOUND TO BE ACCEPTABLE TO CAREGIVERS OF IN-PATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
14 2167  40 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA IN HELPING CANCER PATIENTS AND CAREGIVERS MANAGE THE STRESS OF A NATURAL DISASTER: A BRIEF REPORT ON HURRICANE HARVEY. BACKGROUND: THIS SMALL QUALITATIVE STUDY REPORTS ON THE EXPERIENCES OF PATIENTS AND FAMILY CAREGIVERS WHO PARTICIPATED IN A DYADIC YOGA PILOT TRIAL WHILE UNDERGOING CANCER TREATMENT IN THE MIDST OF HURRICANE HARVEY. OUR PRIMARY PURPOSE WAS TO DETERMINE IF PARTICIPANTS IMPLEMENTED COMPONENTS OF THE PROGRAM TO COPE WITH THE STRESSORS ASSOCIATED WITH HURRICANE HARVEY AND IF THEY PERCEIVED BENEFITS FROM THE YOGA PRACTICES. METHODS: WE ADMINISTERED BRIEF SEMISTRUCTURED INTERVIEWS TO THE DYADS PARTICIPATING IN A DYADIC YOGA PILOT TRIAL. PARTICIPANTS (N = 5 DYADS) WERE ASKED TO DISCUSS THEIR EXPERIENCE WITH HURRICANE HARVEY, INCLUDING FACTORS THAT HELPED THEM COPE WITH THE EVENT WHILE RECEIVING TREATMENT. RESULT: PATIENTS HAD A MEAN AGE OF 55.6 YEARS, WERE MOSTLY NON-HISPANIC WHITE, MALE, AND HAD ADVANCE STAGE HEAD AND NECK CANCER. CAREGIVERS HAD A MEAN AGE OF 58 YEARS AND WERE MAINLY NON-HISPANIC WHITE AND FEMALE. ANALYSES OF THE INTERVIEWS REVEALED 2 OVERARCHING THEMES: (1) THE STORM'S NEGATIVE IMPACT AND (2) THE USE OF YOGA TO COPE WITH THE HURRICANE-RELATED STRESSORS. CONCLUSIONS: PATIENT-CAREGIVER DYADS EXPERIENCED PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS DURING THE STORM AND/OR ITS AFTERMATH. DYADS USED YOGA TECHNIQUES TO COPE WITH THESE PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESSORS. YOGA SERVED AS A MEANS OF SOCIAL SUPPORT AS DYADS EITHER PARTICIPATED IN THESE ACTIVITIES TOGETHER OR WITH OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
15 1551  31 LAUGHTER YOGA, ADULTS LIVING WITH PARKINSONS DISEASE, AND CAREGIVERS: A PILOT STUDY. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY EXPLORED OUTCOMES OF LAUGHTER YOGA IN ADULTS WITH PARKINSONS DISEASE (PD) AND THEIR CAREGIVERS. LAUGHTER HAS BEEN SHOWN TO GENERALLY IMPROVE MOOD IN PHYSICALLY HEALTHY ADULTS, AND SPECIFICALLY IN ADULTS WITH HEART DISEASE OR CANCER, BUT LITTLE RESEARCH EXISTS REGARDING THE IMPACT OF LAUGHTER IN ADULTS WITH PARKINSONS DISEASE. LOW MOOD IS FREQUENTLY A CO-MORBID CONDITION FOR ADULTS WITH PARKINSONS DISEASE, AND CAN NEGATIVELY AFFECT THEIR CAREGIVERS. DESIGN: PRE-EXPERIMENTAL (O1 X O2) PRETEST-POSTTEST DESIGN. SETTINGS/LOCATION: DATA COLLECTION OCCURRED AT SIX UNIQUE PD SUPPORT GROUPS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. SUBJECTS: PARTICIPANTS (N = 85) COMPRISED A CONVENIENCE SAMPLE OF ADULTS DIAGNOSED WITH PARKINSONS DISEASE (N = 47) AND ACCOMPANYING CAREGIVERS (N = 38). INTERVENTION: SUBJECTS PARTICIPATED IN A 45-MIN LAUGHTER YOGA (LY) SESSION CONDUCTED BY A CERTIFIED LAUGHTER YOGA TEACHER. OUTCOME MEASURES: THIS STUDY UTILIZED THE LAUGHTER YOGA "HOW DO YOU FEEL?" (HDYF) FORM. THE FORM CONSISTS OF A SERIES OF 10 SCALES LABELED "WELL-BEING" MEASURES INCLUDING ENTHUSIASM, ENERGY LEVEL, MOOD, OPTIMISM, STRESS LEVEL, LEVEL OF FRIENDSHIP WITH GROUP MEMBERS, LEVEL OF AWARENESS ABOUT BREATHING, LEVEL OF MUSCLE RELAXATION, LEVEL OF MENTAL RELAXATION, AND ABILITY TO LAUGH WITHOUT A REASON. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: PAIRED SAMPLE T-TESTS REVEAL STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN WELL-BEING FOR ADULTS WITH PD AND THEIR CAREGIVERS AFTER ATTENDING AN LY SESSION. THERAPISTS AND OTHER CLINICIANS SHOULD CONSIDER UTILIZING THIS UNIQUE TECHNIQUE WITH ADULTS WITH PD TO ADDRESS CO-MORBID LOW-MOOD CONDITIONS AND INCLUDE CAREGIVERS IN THE LY SESSIONS FOR SUPPORT AND THEIR OWN BENEFIT.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
16 2864  46 YOGA-BASED INTERVENTION FOR CAREGIVERS OF OUTPATIENTS WITH PSYCHOSIS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED PILOT STUDY. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: THE USE OF YOGA AS AN INTERVENTION FOR CAREGIVERS OF PATIENTS WITH PSYCHOSIS HAS BEEN POORLY STUDIED. THE CURRENT STUDY AIMED TO TEST THE EFFICACY OF A BRIEF YOGA PROGRAM AS AN INTERVENTION IN CAREGIVERS OF OUTPATIENTS WITH FUNCTIONAL PSYCHOTIC DISORDERS USING A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED RESEARCH DESIGN. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CAREGIVERS WHO AGREED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE STUDY (N=29) WERE RANDOMIZED INTO YOGA (N=15) OR WAIT-LIST GROUP (N=14). THEY WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE AND AT THE END OF 3 MONTHS. PATIENTS WHO WERE RANDOMIZED INTO THE YOGA GROUP WERE OFFERED SUPERVISED YOGA TRAINING THRICE A WEEK FOR 4 WEEKS, AFTER WHICH THEY WERE INSTRUCTED TO PRACTICE AT HOME FOR THE NEXT 2 MONTHS. DUE TO THE SMALL SAMPLE SIZE AND SOME VARIABLES NOT BEING NORMALLY DISTRIBUTED, NON-PARAMETRIC STATISTICAL ANALYSIS WAS USED. RESULTS: RESULTS SHOWED SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED BURDEN SCORES AND IMPROVED QUALITY OF LIFE SCORES IN THE YOGA GROUP AS COMPARED TO THE WAIT-LIST GROUP AT THE END OF 3 MONTHS. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SCORES IN CAREGIVERS, OR PSYCHOPATHOLOGY SCORES IN PATIENTS. CONCLUSION: IN CAREGIVERS OF OUTPATIENTS WITH FUNCTIONAL PSYCHOSIS, 4 WEEKS OF TRAINING FOLLOWED BY 3 MONTHS OF HOME PRACTICE OF A YOGA MODULE OFFERED SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGE OVER WAITLIST. YOGA CAN BE OFFERED AS AN INTERVENTION FOR CAREGIVERS OF PATIENTS WITH SEVERE MENTAL DISORDERS. METHODS OF PROVIDING YOGA INTERVENTION CLOSER TO THE COMMUNITY OR USE OF FLEXIBLE MODULES AT HOSPITALS NEEDS FURTHER STUDY.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
17 2398  34 YOGA AND COMPASSION MEDITATION PROGRAM IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE AND SELF-COMPASSION IN FAMILY CAREGIVERS OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE PATIENTS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. AIM: TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF THE PRACTICE OF YOGA IN COMBINATION WITH COMPASSION MEDITATION ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE, ATTENTION, VITALITY AND SELF-COMPASSION OF FAMILY CAREGIVERS OF PATIENTS WITH ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE. METHODS: A TOTAL OF 46 VOLUNTEERS WERE RANDOMLY ALLOCATED TO TWO GROUPS, THE YOGA AND COMPASSION MEDITATION PROGRAM GROUP (N = 25), AND THE CONTROL GROUP (CG) THAT RECEIVED NO TREATMENT (N = 21). THE PROGRAM LASTED 8 WEEKS, AND COMPRISED THREE YOGA AND MEDITATION PRACTICES PER WEEK, WITH EACH SESSION LASTING 1 H AND 15 MIN. QUALITY OF LIFE, ATTENTION, VITALITY, AND SELF-COMPASSION SCORES WERE MEASURED PRE- AND POSTINTERVENTION. RESULTS: THE YOGA AND COMPASSION MEDITATION PROGRAM GROUP SHOWED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS (P < 0.05) ON QUALITY OF LIFE, ATTENTION, VITALITY AND SELF-COMPASSION SCORES AS COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP, WHICH SHOWED NO STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES AT THE POSTINTERVENTION TIME-POINT. CONCLUSIONS: THE FINDINGS OF THE PRESENT STUDY SUGGEST THAT AN 8-WEEK YOGA AND COMPASSION MEDITATION PROGRAM CAN IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE, VITALITY, ATTENTION, AND SELF-COMPASSION OF FAMILY CAREGIVERS OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE PATIENTS.

PURPOSE: TO CONDUCT A MIXED METHODS, PRE-POST, RETROSPECTIVE STUDY ON THE FEASIBILITY, ACCEPTABILITY, AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE LOVEYOURBRAIN YOGA PROGRAM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PEOPLE WERE ELIGIBLE IF THEY WERE A TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY SURVIVOR OR CAREGIVER, AGE 15-70, AMBULATORY, AND CAPABLE OF GENTLE EXERCISE AND GROUP DISCUSSION. WE ANALYZED ATTENDANCE, SATISFACTION, AND MEAN DIFFERENCES IN SCORES ON QUALITY OF LIFE AFTER BRAIN INJURY OVERALL SCALE (QOLIBRI-OS) AND FOUR TBI-QOL/NEURO-QOL SCALES. CONTENT ANALYSIS EXPLORED PERCEPTIONS OF BENEFITS AND AREAS OF IMPROVEMENT. RESULTS: 1563 PEOPLE (82.0%) PARTICIPATED >/=1 CLASS IN 156 PROGRAMS ACROSS 18 STATES AND 3 CANADIAN PROVINCES. MEAN SATISFACTION WAS 9.3 OUT OF 10 (SD 1.0). MIXED EFFECTS LINEAR REGRESSION FOUND SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN QOLIBRI-OS (B 9.70, 95% CI: 8.51, 10.90), RESILIENCE (B 1.30, 95% CI: 0.60, 2.06), POSITIVE AFFECT AND WELL-BEING (B 1.49, 95% CI: 1.14, 1.84), AND COGNITION (B 1.48, 95% CI: 0.78, 2.18) AMONG TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY SURVIVORS (N = 705). NO IMPROVEMENT WAS FOUND IN EMOTIONAL AND BEHAVIORAL DYSREGULATION, HOWEVER, CONTENT ANALYSIS REVEALED BETTER ABILITY TO REGULATE ANXIETY, ANGER, STRESS, AND IMPULSIVITY.

19 1436  28 INCORPORATING YOGA INTO A PEDIATRIC WEIGHT MANAGEMENT PROGRAM: A PILOT STUDY. PURPOSE: TO ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OF YOGA INCORPORATED INTO A PEDIATRIC WEIGHT MANAGEMENT PROGRAM (PROMOTING HEALTH IN TEENS; PHIT YOGA) TO RACIALLY DIVERSE CAREGIVERS AND YOUTH AND TO COMPARE THIS PROGRAM WITH A COHORT THAT RECEIVED A PROGRAM THAT DID NOT INCLUDE YOGA (PHIT KIDS). METHODS: THIRTY CHILDREN WITH OBESITY WERE ENROLLED IN A 12-WEEK PEDIATRIC WEIGHT MANAGEMENT INTERVENTION (PHIT KIDS, N = 17; PHIT YOGA, N = 13). WEIGHT, BMI Z-SCORE (BMIZ), BMI PERCENT OF THE 95TH PERCENTILE, AND HEALTH HABITS ASSESSMENT WERE OBTAINED FROM BOTH COHORTS PRE- AND POST INTERVENTION. ACCEPTABILITY WAS ASSESSED IN THE YOGA COHORT. RESULTS: FIFTY-FOUR PERCENT OF CHILDREN IN THE PHIT YOGA COHORT AND 65% OF CHILDREN IN THE PHIT KIDS COHORT ATTENDED >/=75% OF THE INTERVENTION SESSIONS. SURVEY RESULTS SUPPORT THAT THE PHIT YOGA WAS ACCEPTABLE TO BOTH CAREGIVERS AND CHILDREN. IMPROVEMENTS IN BMIZ WERE OBSERVED IN 50% OF CHILDREN IN EACH COHORT AND BOTH GROUPS IMPROVED ON FIVE OF SEVEN HEALTH HABITS; COHORTS OVERLAPPED ON THREE HABITS (BREAKFAST, SCREEN TIME, AND SUGAR-SWEETENED DRINKS). CONCLUSION: FINDINGS SUPPORT THAT YOGA CLASSES ADDED TO A PEDIATRIC WEIGHT MANAGEMENT PROGRAM ARE FEASIBLE AND ACCEPTABLE IN RACIALLY DIVERSE CHILDREN WITH SEVERE OBESITY AND THEIR CAREGIVERS.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
20 2654  36 YOGA IMPROVES QUALITY OF LIFE AND BENEFIT FINDING IN WOMEN UNDERGOING RADIOTHERAPY FOR BREAST CANCER. THIS STUDY EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) AND PSYCHOSOCIAL OUTCOMES IN WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER UNDERGOING RADIOTHERAPY. SIXTY-ONE WOMEN WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO EITHER A YOGA OR A WAIT-LIST GROUP. YOGA CLASSES WERE TAUGHT BIWEEKLY DURING THE 6 WEEKS OF RADIOTHERAPY. PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED MEASURES OF QOL, FATIGUE, BENEFIT FINDING (FINDING MEANING IN THE CANCER EXPERIENCE), INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS, SLEEP DISTURBANCES, DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, AND ANXIETY BEFORE RADIOTHERAPY AND THEN AGAIN 1 WEEK, 1 MONTH, AND 3 MONTHS AFTER THE END OF RADIOTHERAPY. GENERAL LINEAR MODEL ANALYSES REVEALED THAT COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP, THE YOGA GROUP REPORTED SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER GENERAL HEALTH PERCEPTION (P = .005) AND PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING SCORES (P = .04) 1 WEEK POSTRADIOTHERAPY; HIGHER LEVELS OF INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS 1 MONTH POSTRADIOTHERAPY (P = .01); AND GREATER BENEFIT FINDING 3 MONTHS POSTRADIOTHERAPY (P = .01). THERE WERE NO OTHER GROUP DIFFERENCES IN OTHER QOL SUBSCALES FOR FATIGUE, DEPRESSION, OR SLEEP SCORES. EXPLORATORY ANALYSES INDICATED THAT INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS 1 MONTH AFTER RADIOTHERAPY WERE SIGNIFICANTLY POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH BENEFIT FINDING 3 MONTHS AFTER RADIOTHERAPY (R = .36, P = .011). OUR RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE YOGA PROGRAM WAS ASSOCIATED WITH STATISTICALLY AND CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN ASPECTS OF QOL.	2010

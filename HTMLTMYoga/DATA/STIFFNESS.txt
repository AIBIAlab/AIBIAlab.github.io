2 2242 20 THE INFLUENCE OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND YOGA ON CENTRAL ARTERIAL STIFFNESS. PURPOSE: CENTRAL ARTERIAL STIFFNESS IS AN ACCEPTED RISK FACTOR FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE. WHILE AEROBIC ACTIVITY IS ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCED STIFFNESS THE INFLUENCE OF PRACTICING YOGA IS UNKNOWN. THE AIMS OF THIS STUDY WERE TO: 1) EVALUATE ARTERIAL STIFFNESS IN MIDDLE-AGED ADULTS WHO REGULARLY PRACTICED YOGA, PERFORMED REGULAR EXERCISE, OR WERE INACTIVE, 2) EVALUATE THE REPRODUCIBILITY OF ARTERIAL STIFFNESS MEASURED IN THE LEFT AND RIGHT CAROTID ARTERY AND BY PULSE WAVE VELOCITY (PWV). METHODS: TWENTY SIX HEALTHY SUBJECTS (MALE AND FEMALE, 40-65 YRS OLD) WERE TESTED ON TWO SEPARATE DAYS. CAROTID ARTERY DISTENSIBILITY (DC) WAS MEASURED WITH ULTRASOUND. PHYSICAL ACTIVITY WAS DETERMINED BY QUESTIONNAIRE. RESULTS: YOGA AND AEROBIC SUBJECTS HAD SIMILAR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY LEVELS. YOGA AND AEROBIC GROUPS WERE NOT DIFFERENT IN EITHER DC (P = 0.26) OR PWV (P = 0.21). THE SEDENTARY GROUP HAD LOWER DC AND HIGHER PWV COMPARED TO THE AEROBIC AND YOGA GROUPS (BOTH, P < 0.001). STIFFNESS MEASURES WERE RELIABLE DAY TO DAY (COEFFICIENTS OF VARIATION APPROXIMATELY 2.5%) AND SIMILAR BETWEEN LEFT AND RIGHT ARTERIES (CV = 2.2%). CONCLUSION: PHYSICAL ACTIVITY WAS A STRONG PREDICTOR OF BOTH MEASURES OF ARTERIAL STIFFNESS, ALTHOUGH OTHER FACTORS SUCH AS NUTRITIONAL STATUS NEED TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR. AN INDEPENDENT EFFECT OF PRACTICING YOGA COULD NOT BE DETECTED. STIFFNESS MEASURES WERE REPRODUCIBLE AND LEFT AND RIGHT SIDES WERE CONSISTENT WITH EACH OTHER.	2008	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
3 1377 24 IMPACT OF HOT YOGA ON ARTERIAL STIFFNESS AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN NORMAL AND OVERWEIGHT/OBESE ADULTS. BACKGROUND: OBESITY IS ASSOCIATED WITH ARTERIAL STIFFENING AND DIMINISHED QUALITY OF LIFE. BIKRAM YOGA MAY BE A FEASIBLE ALTERNATIVE TO TRADITIONAL EXERCISE AMONG OBESE INDIVIDUALS. ACCORDINGLY, THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE IMPACT OF BIKRAM YOGA, A HEATED STYLE OF HATHA YOGA, ON ARTERIAL STIFFNESS IN NORMAL AND OVERWEIGHT/OBESE ADULTS. METHODS: FORTY-THREE (23 NORMAL BODY MASS INDEX OR BMI; 20 OVERWEIGHT/OBESE) APPARENTLY HEALTHY PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED AN 8-WEEK BIKRAM YOGA INTERVENTION. BODY COMPOSITION WAS ESTIMATED VIA DUAL ENERGY X-RAY ABSORPTIOMETRY, ARTERIAL STIFFNESS WAS MEASURED VIA BRACHIALANKLE PULSE WAVE VELOCITY, AND HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE WAS ASSESSED VIA RAND 36-ITEM SHORT FORM SURVEY AT BASELINE AND AT THE END OF THE 8-WEEK INTERVENTION. RESULTS: AFTER THE INTERVENTION, BRACHIAL-ANKLE PULSE WAVE VELOCITY DECREASED (P < .05) IN OVERWEIGHT/OBESE PARTICIPANTS WHILE NO SUCH CHANGES WERE OBSERVED IN NORMAL BMI PARTICIPANTS. IN THE QUALITY OF LIFE MEASURES, EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING IMPROVED (P < .05) IN BOTH GROUPS, AND GENERAL HEALTH IMPROVED (P < .05) ONLY IN THE NORMAL WEIGHT BMI GROUP. CONCLUSION: BIKRAM YOGA AMELIORATES ARTERIAL STIFFNESS IN OVERWEIGHT/OBESE ADULTS AND CAN POSITIVELY IMPACT QUALITY OF LIFE REGARDLESS OF BMI.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
4 2700 14 YOGA INTERVENTION FOR AN ADOLESCENT WITH JUVENILE IDIOPATHIC ARTHRITIS: A CASE STUDY. JUVENILE IDIOPATHIC ARTHRITIS (JIA) IS A CHRONIC RHEUMATIC DISEASE ASSOCIATED WITH PAIN, STIFFNESS, AND PSYCHOSOCIAL DIFFICULTIES. THE PURPOSE OF THIS CASE STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE IMPACT OF A YOGA INTERVENTION ON PAIN AND MORNING STIFFNESS IN AN ADOLESCENT FEMALE WITH JIA. A SECONDARY AIM WAS TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF THIS INTERVENTION ON SELF-EFFICACY, MINDFULNESS, HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE, AND DISEASE ACTIVITY. A 17-Y-OLD FEMALE WITH JIA PARTICIPATED IN 3 YOGA GROUPS AND HOME YOGA PRACTICE WITH A DIGITAL VIDEO DISC. SHE ENGAGED IN DAILY SELF-MONITORING OF PAIN AND STIFFNESS AND COMPLETED QUESTIONNAIRES ASSESSING PSYCHOSOCIAL FUNCTIONING AND DISEASE ACTIVITY AT PRE- AND POSTINTERVENTION, AND PSYCHOSOCIAL FUNCTIONING AT 3-MO FOLLOW-UP. PRIMARY OUTCOMES WERE EVALUATED USING QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL SINGLE-CASE DESIGN STRUCTURE (IE, ABAB), WITH EMPHASIS ON THE REPORT OF MEANS. RESULTS SUGGESTED THAT YOGA REDUCED PAIN INTENSITY, STIFFNESS INTENSITY, AND DURATION OF MORNING STIFFNESS. OUTCOMES FOR DISEASE ACTIVITY ALSO SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS. MODEST CHANGES WERE REVEALED ON PSYCHOSOCIAL OUTCOME MEASURES, HOWEVER NOT CONSISTENTLY IN THE DIRECTION OF HYPOTHESES. ANECDOTAL REPORTS FROM THE PARTICIPANT INDICATED ACCEPTABILITY OF THE INTERVENTION AND IMPROVEMENTS IN PAIN AND STIFFNESS ATTRIBUTED TO ENGAGING IN THE YOGA INTERVENTION. MORE RESEARCH IS WARRANTED TO FURTHER EXPLORE THE IMPACT OF YOGA FOR YOUTH WITH JIA AS AN ADJUNCTIVE COMPONENT OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY TREATMENT TARGETING PAIN, STIFFNESS, DISEASE ACTIVITY, AND PSYCHOSOCIAL FACTORS.	2018

6  928 18 EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA ON ARTERIAL STIFFNESS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. OBJECTIVES: ARTERIAL STIFFNESS IS A MAJOR CARDIOVASCULAR (CV) RISK AND AN INDEPENDENT STRONG PREDICTOR OF CV MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY. THE AIM OF THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW IS TO EVALUATE THE CLINICAL OR INTERVENTIONAL STUDIES THAT ASSESSED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA ON ARTERIAL STIFFNESS IN PARTICIPANTS OF ANY AGE OR SEX, HEALTHY OR WITH ANY CONDITIONS. DESIGN: SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF CLINICAL TRIALS OR INTERVENTIONAL STUDIES. DATA SOURCES: COCHRANE LIBRARY, MEDLINE/PUBMED, SCOPUS, AND GOOGLE SCHOLAR DATABASES. REVIEW METHODS: DATABASES WERE SEARCHED TILL JULY 2019 FOR CLINICAL TRIALS OR INTERVENTIONAL STUDIES WHETHER CONTROLLED OR UNCONTROLLED, RANDOMIZED OR NON-RANDOMIZED STUDIES ASSESSING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON ARTERIAL STIFFNESS. QUALITY OF THE STUDIES WAS ASSESSED BY USING PHYSIOTHERAPY EVIDENCE DATABASE (PEDRO) SCALE. RESULTS: SEVEN FULL-TEXT ARTICLES (TOTAL NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS = 362) THAT EVALUATED THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON ARTERIAL STIFFNESS WERE INCLUDED IN THIS REVIEW. THERE WERE THREE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDIES AND FOUR WERE NON-CONTROLLED STUDIES (SINGLE GROUP STUDIES). FOUR STUDIES HAVE SHOWN SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN ARTERIAL STIFFNESS, WHILE THREE STUDIES DID NOT FIND ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN ARTERIAL STIFFNESS. THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF YOGA INTERVENTION ON ARTERIAL STIFFNESS IN YOUNG ADULTS AND ELDERLY HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS ARE ENCOURAGING. METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY WAS GOOD FOR ONE STUDY, MODERATE FOR TWO STUDIES AND POOR FOR FOUR STUDIES. CONCLUSIONS: THIS REVIEW SHOWS THAT YOGA PRACTICE IS EFFECTIVE IN PREVENTING OR REDUCING THE ARTERIAL STIFFNESS IN YOUNG HEALTHY AND OBESE, AND ELDERLY HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS. AS THE METHODOLOGY OF MANY STUDIES IS OF LOW QUALITY AND SAFETY MEASURES WERE NOT REPORTED, THERE IS A NEED OF QUALITY RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS OF YOGA EFFECTS ON ARTERIAL STIFFNESS AMONG HIGH RISK INDIVIDUALS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
7 2075 26 THE EFFECT OF BIKRAM YOGA ON ARTERIAL STIFFNESS IN YOUNG AND OLDER ADULTS. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: BIKRAM YOGA IS THE MOST POPULAR FORM OF HOT YOGA, DESPITE THE LIMITED INFORMATION AVAILABLE ON ITS CARDIOVASCULAR BENEFITS. THIS STUDY SOUGHT TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF BIKRAM YOGA ON ARTERIAL STIFFNESS AND INSULIN RESISTANCE IN YOUNG AND OLDER ADULTS. METHODS: TWENTY-FOUR YOUNG (MEAN AGE+/-STANDARD DEVIATION, 30+/-1 YEARS) AND 18 MIDDLE-AGED AND OLDER (MEAN AGE, 53+/-2 YEARS) ADULTS COMPLETED AN 8-WEEK BIKRAM YOGA INTERVENTION. BIKRAM YOGA CLASSES WERE PERFORMED FOR 90 MINUTES PER SESSION, THREE TIMES PER WEEK, IN A ROOM HEATED TO 40.5 DEGREES C WITH 40%--60% RELATIVE HUMIDITY. RESULTS: BODY MASS, BODY FAT PERCENTAGE, BLOOD PRESSURE, AND FASTING BLOOD GLUCOSE AND TRIGLYCERIDE CONCENTRATIONS DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE AS A RESULT OF THE INTERVENTION IN EITHER THE YOUNG OR THE OLDER GROUP. TRUNK FLEXIBILITY, AS MEASURED BY THE SIT-AND-REACH TEST, INCREASED IN BOTH GROUPS (P<0.01). TOTAL (P<0.05) AND LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN CHOLESTEROL (P<0.05) LEVELS, PLASMA INSULIN CONCENTRATIONS (P<0.01), AND SCORES ON THE HOMEOSTATIC MODEL OF THE ASSESSMENT OF INSULIN RESISTANCE (P<0.01) DECREASED IN OLDER ADULTS, WHEREAS TOTAL AND HIGH-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN CHOLESTEROL CONCENTRATIONS WERE REDUCED IN YOUNG ADULTS (ALL P<0.05). CAROTID ARTERY COMPLIANCE (P<0.05) WAS INCREASED AND BETA-STIFFNESS INDEX DECREASED IN YOUNG (P<0.05) BUT NOT IN OLDER ADULTS. CAROTID PULSE PRESSURE DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE IN EITHER GROUP. CONCLUSION: A RELATIVELY SHORT-TERM BIKRAM YOGA INTERVENTION IMPROVED ARTERIAL STIFFNESS IN YOUNG BUT NOT OLDER ADULTS AND SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED INSULIN RESISTANCE INDEX IN OLDER BUT NOT YOUNG ADULTS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
8 1298 19 HATHA YOGA AND VASCULAR FUNCTION: RESULTS FROM CROSS-SECTIONAL AND INTERVENTIONAL STUDIES. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF HATHA YOGA ON ARTERIAL ELASTICITY AND ENDOTHELIAL FUNCTION. FIRST, A CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY WAS PERFORMED TO DETERMINE WHETHER YOGA PRACTITIONERS WOULD DEMONSTRATE GREATER ARTERIAL COMPLIANCE AND ENDOTHELIUM-DEPENDENT VASODILATION THAN THEIR SEDENTARY PEERS. SECOND, AN INTERVENTION STUDY INVOLVING 13 SEDENTARY MIDDLE-AGED AND OLDER ADULTS (51 +/- 7 YEARS) WAS PERFORMED TO DETERMINE WHETHER 12 WEEKS OF HATHA YOGA WOULD ELICIT INCREASES IN ARTERIAL COMPLIANCE AND ENDOTHELIAL FUNCTION. IN THE CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY INVOLVING A TOTAL OF 34 SUBJECTS, THERE WERE NO GROUP DIFFERENCES IN BODY FATNESS, BLOOD LIPID AND LIPOPROTEIN CONCENTRATIONS, CAROTID ARTERY COMPLIANCE OR BRACHIAL ARTERY FLOW-MEDIATED DILATION (FMD). HEMOGLOBIN A1C WAS LOWER IN YOGA PRACTITIONERS THAN IN SEDENTARY ADULTS (P < 0.05). TOTAL CHOLESTEROL AND HEMOGLOBIN A1C DECREASED AFTER THE INTERVENTION (P < 0.05) WHILE CAROTID ARTERY COMPLIANCE AND BRACHIAL ARTERY FMD DID NOT CHANGE. THE RESULTS OF BOTH CROSS-SECTIONAL AND INTERVENTIONAL STUDIES INDICATE THAT REGULAR PRACTICE OF HATHA YOGA IS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVEMENTS IN VASCULAR FUNCTIONS.	2013

10 2590 22 YOGA FOR MANAGING KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS IN OLDER WOMEN: A PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: OSTEOARTHRITIS (OA) IS A COMMON PROBLEM IN OLDER WOMEN THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH PAIN AND DISABILITIES. ALTHOUGH YOGA IS RECOMMENDED AS AN EXERCISE INTERVENTION TO MANAGE ARTHRITIS, THERE IS LIMITED EVIDENCE DOCUMENTING ITS EFFECTIVENESS, WITH LITTLE KNOWN ABOUT ITS LONG TERM BENEFITS. THIS STUDY'S AIMS WERE TO ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY AND POTENTIAL EFFICACY OF A HATHA YOGA EXERCISE PROGRAM IN MANAGING OA-RELATED SYMPTOMS IN OLDER WOMEN WITH KNEE OA. METHODS: ELIGIBLE PARTICIPANTS (N=36; MEAN AGE 72 YEARS) WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO 8-WEEK YOGA PROGRAM INVOLVING GROUP AND HOME-BASED SESSIONS OR WAIT-LIST CONTROL. THE YOGA INTERVENTION PROGRAM WAS DEVELOPED BY A GROUP OF YOGA EXPERTS (N=5). THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS THE WESTERN ONTARIO AND MCMASTER UNIVERSITIES OSTEOARTHRITIS INDEX (WOMAC) TOTAL SCORE THAT MEASURES KNEE OA PAIN, STIFFNESS, AND FUNCTION AT 8 WEEKS. THE SECONDARY OUTCOMES, PHYSICAL FUNCTION OF THE LOWER EXTREMITIES, BODY MASS INDEX (BMI), QUALITY OF SLEEP (QOS), AND QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL), WERE MEASURED USING WEIGHT, HEIGHT, THE SHORT PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE BATTERY (SPPB), THE PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX (PSQI), THE CANTRIL SELF-ANCHORING LADDER, AND THE SF12V2 HEALTH SURVEY. DATA WERE COLLECTED AT BASELINE, 4 WEEKS AND 8 WEEKS, AND 20 WEEKS. RESULTS: THE RECRUITMENT TARGET WAS MET, WITH STUDY RETENTION AT 95%. BASED ON ANCOVAS, PARTICIPANTS IN THE TREATMENT GROUP EXHIBITED SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER IMPROVEMENT IN WOMAC PAIN (ADJUSTED MEANS [SE]) (8.3 [.67], 5.8 [.67]; P=.01), STIFFNESS (4.7 [.28], 3.4 [.28]; P=.002) AND SPPB (REPEATED CHAIR STANDS) (2.0 [.23], 2.8 [.23]; P=.03) AT 8 WEEKS. SIGNIFICANT TREATMENT AND TIME EFFECTS WERE SEEN IN WOMAC PAIN (7.0 [.46], 5.4 [.54]; P=.03), FUNCTION (24.5 [1.8], 19.9 [1.6]; P=.01) AND TOTAL SCORES (35.4 [2.3], 28.6 [2.1]; P=.01) FROM 4 TO 20 WEEKS. SLEEP DISTURBANCE WAS IMPROVED BUT THE PSQI TOTAL SCORE DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY AT 20 WEEKS. CHANGES IN BMI AND QOL WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT. NO YOGA RELATED ADVERSE EVENTS WERE OBSERVED. CONCLUSIONS: A WEEKLY YOGA PROGRAM WITH HOME PRACTICE IS FEASIBLE, ACCEPTABLE, AND SAFE FOR OLDER WOMEN WITH KNEE OA, AND SHOWS THERAPEUTIC BENEFITS.

11 2076 22 THE EFFECT OF BIKRAM YOGA ON ENDOTHELIAL FUNCTION IN YOUNG AND MIDDLE-AGED AND OLDER ADULTS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS INVESTIGATION WAS TO DETERMINE IF BIKRAM YOGA, A STYLE OF HEATED HATHA YOGA, WOULD IMPROVE ENDOTHELIAL FUNCTION IN YOUNG AND MIDDLE-AGED AND OLDER, HEALTHY ADULTS. THIS TRIAL WAS PERFORMED IN 36 YOUNG (N = 17) AND MIDDLE-AGED AND OLDER ADULTS (N = 19) WHO COMPLETED 3 WEEKLY BIKRAM YOGA CLASSES FOR 8 WEEKS. HEIGHT, BODY WEIGHT AND BODY COMPOSITION WERE DETERMINED AND ENDOTHELIAL FUNCTION WAS MEASURED NONINVASIVELY USING BRACHIAL ARTERY FLOW-MEDIATED DILATION (FMD) BEFORE AND AFTER THE INTERVENTION. NO CHANGES IN BODY WEIGHT, BMI OR BODY FAT PERCENTAGE OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE INTERVENTION IN EITHER GROUP. BRACHIAL ARTERY FMD WAS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED IN MIDDLE-AGED AND OLDER (P < 0.05) BUT NOT IN YOUNG ADULTS AS A RESULT OF THE INTERVENTION. THE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT A RELATIVELY SHORT-TERM BIKRAM YOGA PRACTICE MIGHT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE VASCULAR ENDOTHELIAL FUNCTION IN MIDDLE-AGED AND OLDER ADULTS. WHILE APPARENTLY HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS IN THIS STUDY EXPERIENCED NO ADVERSE EVENTS, THOSE WITH PREEXISTING CONDITIONS SHOULD TAKE CAUTION AND CONSULT WITH A PHYSICIAN PRIOR TO ENGAGING IN THIS STYLE OF YOGA.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
12 1485 13 INTEGRATIVE APPROACH COMBINING AYURVEDA, COUNSELLING, YOGA AND MEDITATION WITH CONVENTIONAL MANAGEMENT OF ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS - A CASE REPORT. LIFELONG MEDICATIONS ARE REQUIRED FOR SYMPTOMATIC RELIEF IN ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS (AS). WE REPORT THE POTENTIAL OF AN INTEGRATIVE APPROACH IN REDUCING DEPENDENCE ON STEROIDS AND PAIN MEDICATIONS IN CHRONIC AS. A 59-YEAR-OLD HLA-B27 POSITIVE MALE PATIENT SUFFERING FROM AS FOR 40 YEARS SOUGHT AYURVEDIC TREATMENT FOR RELAPSE OF PAIN, STIFFNESS, FATIGUE, INTERMITTENT CONSTIPATION AND DISTURBED SLEEP. AYURVEDIC DIAGNOSIS WAS AMAVATA (A CLINICAL CONDITION CHARACTERISED BY JOINT INFLAMMATION) THE PATIENT WAS MANAGED AS OUTPATIENT FOR ELEVEN DAYS AND HOSPITALISED FOR THIRTY THREE DAYS. INTERNAL MEDICINES AND EXTERNAL THERAPIES WITH DIET MODIFICATION, LIFESTYLE ADJUSTMENTS, COUNSELLING, YOGA AND IAM TECHNIQUE (INTEGRATED AMRITA MEDITATION TECHNIQUE ) WERE ADMINISTERED DURING THE HOSPITAL STAY. AT YEARLY FOLLOW UP, C-REACTIVE PROTEIN WAS REDUCED TO 15.7 MG/L FROM THE BASELINE VALUE OF 37.5 MG/L, AND ESR FROM 103 MM/H TO 8 MM/H INDICATING REDUCTION IN INFLAMMATION. THE DOSE OF NSAID AND DMARD (DISEASE MODIFYING ANTIRHEUMATIC DRUG) COULD BE REDUCED FROM ONCE IN TWENTY-FOUR HOURS TO ONCE IN EIGHTY-FOUR HOURS AND STEROIDS FROM TWICE DAILY TO ONCE IN A WEEK. THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN PAIN AND STIFFNESS. INTEGRATION OF AYURVEDA AND YOGA WITH CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT CAN REDUCE DRUG DEPENDENCE AND IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE IN AS.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
13  511 13 COMPARATIVE STUDY OF CONVENTIONAL THERAPY AND ADDITIONAL YOGASANAS FOR KNEE REHABILITATION AFTER TOTAL KNEE ARTHROPLASTY. BACKGROUND: AMONGST VARIOUS MODALITIES OF POST OPERATIVE REHABILITATION IN A TOTAL KNEE REPLACEMENT (TKR) SURGERY, THIS STUDY FOCUSES ON EVALUATING THE EFFECT OF ADDITIONAL YOGA THERAPY ON FUNCTIONAL OUTCOME OF TKR PATIENTS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A COMPARATIVE STUDY WAS DONE TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF CONVENTIONAL PHYSIOTHERAPY AND ADDITIONAL YOGA ASANAS, ON 56 PATIENTS UNDERGOING TOTAL KNEE ARTHROPLASTY DUE TO OSTEOARTHRITIS. AFTER OBTAINING WRITTEN INFORMED CONSENT, THE PATIENTS WERE ALTERNATELY ASSIGNED TO TWO GROUPS: CONVENTIONAL AND EXPERIMENTAL. BASELINE WOMAC SCORES FOR PAIN AND STIFFNESS WERE TAKEN ON THIRD POST OPERATIVE DAY. THE SUBJECTS IN CONVENTIONAL GROUP RECEIVED PHYSIOTHERAPY REHABILITATION PROGRAM OF SANCHETI INSTITUTE WHERE THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED, THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP RECEIVED ADDITIONAL MODIFIED YOGA ASANAS ONCE DAILY BY THE THERAPIST. AFTER DISCHARGE FROM THE HOSPITAL, PATIENTS WERE PROVIDED WITH WRITTEN INSTRUCTIONS AND PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE ASANAS, TWO SETS OF WOMAC QUESTIONNAIRE WITH STAMPED AND ADDRESSED ENVELOPES AND WERE INSTRUCTED TO PERFORM YOGA ASANAS 3 DAYS/WEEK. SUBJECTS FILLED THE QUESTIONNAIRE AFTER 6 WEEKS AND 3 MONTHS FROM THE DAY OF SURGERY AND MAILED BACK. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE WAS WOMAC QUESTIONNAIRE WHICH CONSISTS OF 24 QUESTIONS, EACH CORRESPONDING TO A VISUAL ANALOG SCALE, DESIGNED TO MEASURE PATIENT'S PERCEPTION OF PAIN, STIFFNESS AND FUNCTION. RESULTS: THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE (P<0.05) FOR ALL THE GROUPS FOR PAIN, STIFFNESS AND FUNCTION SUBSCALES OF WOMAC SCALE. THE PAIN AND STIFFNESS WAS FOUND TO BE LESS IN EXPERIMENTAL GROUP RECEIVING ADDITIONAL YOGA THERAPY THAN IN CONVENTIONAL GROUP ON 3(RD) POST OPERATIVE DAY, 6 WEEKS AND 3 MONTHS AFTER THE SURGERY. CONCLUSION: A COMBINATION OF PHYSIOTHERAPY AND YOGA ASANA PROTOCOL WORKS BETTER THAN ONLY PHYSIOTHERAPY PROTOCOL. LARGER AND BLINDED STUDY IS NEEDED.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
14 1528 17 IYENGAR YOGA FOR TREATING SYMPTOMS OF OSTEOARTHRITIS OF THE KNEES: A PILOT STUDY. OBJECTIVES: THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF RHEUMATOLOGY (ACR) GUIDELINES FOR THE MEDICAL MANAGEMENT OF OSTEOARTHRITIS (OA) EMPHASIZE THE USE OF NONPHARMACOLOGIC INTERVENTIONS INCLUDING EXERCISE. IMPLEMENTATION OF AN EXERCISE PROGRAM CAN BE DIFFICULT FOR PATIENTS, AND LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES SUCH AS YOGA. THE AIM OF THIS PILOT STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY OF USING YOGA IN THE TRADITION OF B.K.S. IYENGAR TO TREAT THE SYMPTOMS OF OSTEOARTHRITIS OF THE KNEE. DESIGN: PARTICIPANTS WERE INSTRUCTED IN MODIFIED IYENGAR YOGA POSTURES DURING 90-MINUTE CLASSES ONCE WEEKLY FOR 8 WEEKS. SUBJECTS: PARTICIPANTS MET ACR CRITERIA FOR OSTEOARTHRITIS OF THE KNEE AND COMPLETED A MEDICAL HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION, WESTERN ONTARIO AND MCMASTER UNIVERSITIES OSTEOARTHRITIS INDEX (WOMAC), ARTHRITIS IMPACT MEASUREMENT SCALE 2 (AIMS2), PATIENT GLOBAL ASSESSMENT (GA) BY VISUAL ANALOG SCALE (VAS), PHYSICIAN GA BY VAS, AND 50-FOOT WALK TIME BEFORE AND FOLLOWING AN 8-WEEK COURSE OF YOGA INSTRUCTION. ELEVEN (11) SUBJECTS ENROLLED, NINE COMPLETED AT LEAST ONE SESSION AND SEVEN (SIX OF WHOM WERE OBESE) HAD DATA FROM PRE- AND POST-COURSE TIME POINTS AVAILABLE FOR ANALYSIS. RESULTS: STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN WOMAC PAIN, WOMAC PHYSICAL FUNCTION, AND AIMS2 AFFECT WERE OBSERVED WHEN PARTICIPANTS' STATUS WERE COMPARED TO THEIR PRE-COURSE STATUS. WOMAC STIFFNESS, AIMS2 SYMPTOMS, SOCIAL AND ROLE, PHYSICIAN GA, AND PATIENT GA MEASURED TRENDS IN IMPROVEMENT OF SYMPTOMS. NO ADVERSE EVENTS FROM TREATMENT WERE REPORTED. CONCLUSIONS: THIS PILOT STUDY SUGGESTS THAT YOGA MAY PROVIDE A FEASIBLE TREATMENT OPTION FOR PREVIOUSLY YOGA-NAIVE, OBESE PATIENTS >50 YEARS OF AGE AND OFFERS POTENTIAL REDUCTIONS IN PAIN AND DISABILITY CAUSED BY KNEE OA. FUTURE STUDIES SHOULD COMPARE YOGA TO OTHER NONPHARMACOLOGIC INTERVENTIONS FOR KNEE OA, SUCH AS PATIENT EDUCATION OR QUADRICEPS-STRENGTHENING EXERCISES.	2005	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
15 1045 36 EFFECTS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS PRACTISED IN HEATED AND THERMONEUTRAL CONDITIONS ON ENDOTHELIUM-DEPENDENT VASODILATATION: THE BIKRAM YOGA HEART STUDY. NEW FINDINGS: WHAT IS THE CENTRAL QUESTION OF THIS STUDY? DOES THE HEATED PRACTICE ENVIRONMENT ENHANCE THE EFFECTS OF BIKRAM YOGA ON ENDOTHELIUM-DEPENDENT VASODILATATION IN HEALTHY, MIDDLE-AGED ADULTS? WHAT IS THE MAIN FINDING AND ITS IMPORTANCE? THE PRIMARY FINDING FROM THIS INVESTIGATION IS THAT THE HATHA YOGA POSTURES IN THE BIKRAM YOGA SERIES PRODUCE SIMILAR ENHANCEMENTS IN ENDOTHELIUM-DEPENDENT VASODILATATION IN HEALTHY, MIDDLE-AGED ADULTS REGARDLESS OF ENVIRONMENTAL TEMPERATURE. THESE FINDINGS HIGHLIGHT THE EFFICACY OF YOGA POSTURES IN PRODUCING IMPROVEMENTS IN VASCULAR HEALTH AND DOWNPLAY THE NECESSITY OF THE HEATED PRACTICE ENVIRONMENT IN INDUCING VASCULAR ADAPTATIONS. ABSTRACT: WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY DOCUMENTED IMPROVEMENTS IN ENDOTHELIUM-DEPENDENT VASODILATATION WITH A BIKRAM (HOT) YOGA INTERVENTION IN MIDDLE-AGED ADULTS. AT PRESENT, THE EFFECT OF ENVIRONMENTAL TEMPERATURE IN HOT YOGA ON ENDOTHELIAL FUNCTION IS UNKNOWN. THE PURPOSE OF THIS INVESTIGATION WAS TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTS OF BIKRAM YOGA INTERVENTIONS PERFORMED IN HEATED OR THERMONEUTRAL CONDITIONS ON ENDOTHELIUM-DEPENDENT VASODILATATION. FIFTY-TWO SEDENTARY BUT APPARENTLY HEALTHY ADULTS AGED 40-60 YEARS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO ONE OF THREE GROUPS: BIKRAM YOGA PRACTISED AT 40.5 DEGREES C (N = 19), BIKRAM YOGA PRACTISED AT 23 DEGREES C (N = 14) OR SEDENTARY TIME CONTROL (N = 19). THE YOGA INTERVENTIONS CONSISTED OF 90 MIN BIKRAM YOGA CLASSES THREE TIMES A WEEK FOR 12 WEEKS. ENDOTHELIUM-DEPENDENT VASODILATATION WAS MEASURED NON-INVASIVELY USING BRACHIAL ARTERY FLOW-MEDIATED DILATATION (FMD). BODY FAT PERCENTAGE DETERMINED VIA DUAL-ENERGY X-RAY ABSORPTIOMETRY WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER IN THE HOT YOGA GROUP AFTER THE INTERVENTION THAN IN THE THERMONEUTRAL YOGA AND CONTROL CONDITIONS. BRACHIAL ARTERY FMD INCREASED (P < 0.05) IN THE THERMONEUTRAL YOGA GROUP AND TENDED TO INCREASE IN THE HOT YOGA GROUP (P = 0.056). NO CHANGES OCCURRED IN THE CONTROL GROUP. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN FMD CHANGE SCORES BETWEEN GROUPS. WE CONCLUDE THAT BIKRAM YOGA PRACTISED IN THERMONEUTRAL CONDITIONS IMPROVED ENDOTHELIUM-DEPENDENT VASODILATATION IN HEALTHY, MIDDLE-AGED ADULTS. THESE NEW FINDINGS HIGHLIGHT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF HATHA YOGA POSTURES ALONE, IN THE ABSENCE OF A HEATED PRACTICE ENVIRONMENT, IN IMPROVING VASCULAR HEALTH AND ARE OF CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE GIVEN THE INCREASED PROPENSITY FOR HEAT INTOLERANCE IN AGEING ADULTS.	2018	

16 2043 19 THE ACUTE EFFECTS OF VINYASA FLOW YOGA ON VASCULAR FUNCTION, LIPID AND GLUCOSE CONCENTRATIONS, AND MOOD. WHILE THE CHRONIC EFFECTS OF CERTAIN STYLES OF YOGA ON CARDIOMETABOLIC FACTORS HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE ACUTE EFFECTS OF A SINGLE YOGA SESSION ON THESE OUTCOMES. MOREOVER, VINYASA YOGA'S POTENTIAL TO MODULATE CARDIOMETABOLIC OUTCOMES HAS NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO DETERMINE THE ACUTE EFFECTS OF A VINYASA YOGA SESSION ON ARTERIAL STIFFNESS, WAVE REFLECTION, LIPID AND GLUCOSE CONCENTRATIONS, AND MOOD IN ADULTS WITH PRIOR YOGA EXPERIENCE. THIRTY YOGA PRACTITIONERS WITH A MINIMUM OF 3 MONTHS OF PRACTICE EXPERIENCE WERE ENROLLED INTO THE STUDY. CAROTID-FEMORAL PULSE WAVE VELOCITY (CF-PWV), AUGMENTATION INDEX (AIX), LIPID PROFILE, GLUCOSE CONCENTRATIONS, AND MOOD (POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE AFFECT SCALE) WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE AND IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING A 1 -H VINYASA YOGA SESSION. AFTER THE YOGA SESSION, PARTICIPANTS HAD SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER AIX (P < 0.001), NON-HDL CHOLESTEROL (P < 0.05), AND NEGATIVE AFFECT (P < 0.01) COMPARED TO BASELINE. THESE RESULTS HIGHLIGHT THE EFFICACY OF A SINGLE BOUT OF YOGA IN ALTERING WAVE REFLECTION WHILE IMPROVING MOOD AND LIPID CONCENTRATIONS IN HEALTHY ADULTS WITH A HISTORY OF YOGA PRACTICE.	2021

BACKGROUND: BENEFITS OF YOGA PRACTICE IN PATIENTS WITH KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS AND RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS REMAINS CONTROVERSIAL. THIS STUDY PERFORMS A META-ANALYSIS TO QUANTIFY THE EFFICIENCY OF YOGA EXERCISE FOR PATIENTS PAIN REDUCTION, FUNCTIONAL RECOVERY, AND GENERAL WELLBEING. METHODS: A COMPUTERIZED SEARCH OF PUBMED AND EMBASE WAS PERFORMED TO IDENTIFY RELEVANT STUDIES. THE OUTCOME MEASURES WERE PAIN, STIFFNESS, AND PHYSICAL FUNCTION. TWO INVESTIGATORS IDENTIFIED ELIGIBLE STUDIES AND EXTRACTED DATA INDEPENDENTLY. THE QUALITY OF CITATIONS WAS MEASURED USING JADAD SCORE. STANDARDIZED MEAN DIFFERENCES (SMDS) WITH 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS (CIS) WERE CALCULATED FOR PAIN, MUSCULOSKELETAL IMPAIRMENT, QUALITY OF LIFE, GENERAL WELLBEING, AND MENTAL WELLBEING. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 13 CLINICAL TRIALS INVOLVING 1557 PATIENTS WITH KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS AND RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS WERE INCLUDED IN FINAL META-ANALYSIS WITH THE AVERAGE JADAD SCORE 2.8. THE SMD WAS -0.98 (95% CI -1.18, -0.78, P < .05) FOR PAIN, -1.83 (95% CI -2.09, -1.57, P < .05) FOR FUNCTIONAL DISABILITY, WAS 0.80 (95% CI 0.59, 1.01, P < .05) FOR SHORT FORM 36 HEALTH SURVEY (SF-36) GENERAL HEALTH, 0.49 (95% CI 0.14, 0.82, P < .05) FOR SF-36 MENTAL HEALTH, AND HAQ WAS -0.55 (95% CI -0.83, -0.26, P < .05) FOR HEALTH ASSOCIATED QUESTIONNAIRE (HAQ). ALL THE RESULTS FAVOR YOGA TRAINING GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: REGULAR YOGA TRAINING IS HELPFUL IN REDUCING KNEE ARTHRITIC SYMPTOMS, PROMOTING PHYSICAL FUNCTION, AND GENERAL WELLBEING IN ARTHRITIC PATIENTS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
18 2083 13 THE EFFECT OF IYENGAR YOGA AND STRENGTHENING EXERCISES FOR PEOPLE LIVING WITH OSTEOARTHRITIS OF THE KNEE: A CASE SERIES. THIS CASE SERIES DESCRIBES THE IMPACT OF VARIOUS FORMS OF EXERCISE ON SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH OSTEOARTHRITIS OF THE KNEE. A GROUP OF 15 WOMEN AND MEN PERFORMED ONE OF THE FOLLOWING: TRADITIONAL STRETCHING AND STRENGTHENING EXERCISES, IYENGAR YOGA, OR NO STRUCTURED GROUP EXERCISE. LOW BACK AND HAMSTRING FLEXIBILITY AND QUADRICEPS STRENGTH AND FUNCTION WERE MONITORED BEFORE AND AFTER THE PROGRAM. THE WESTERN ONTARIO AND MCMASTER UNIVERSITIES OSTEOARTHRITIS INDEX (WOMAC) WAS USED TO ASSESS SUBJECTIVE CHANGE AFTER THE SIX-WEEK INTERVENTION PERIOD. A GLOBAL ASSESSMENT QUESTIONNAIRE WAS ALSO COMPLETED BY EACH PARTICIPANT AND EACH INSTRUCTOR AT THE EXIT SESSIONS TO MEASURE PERCEIVED CHANGES IN IMPROVEMENTS SINCE THE INITIATION OF THE INTERVENTION. THIS STUDY FOUND FUNCTIONAL CHANGES AND IMPROVEMENT IN QUALITY OF LIFE IN TRADITIONAL EXERCISE AND A YOGA BASED APPROACH THAT SHOULD ENCOURAGE FURTHER COMPREHENSIVE AND CAREFULLY DESIGNED STUDIES OF YOGA IN OSTEOARTHRITIS.	2006	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
19 2139 15 THE EFFECTS OF BIKRAM YOGA ON HEALTH: CRITICAL REVIEW AND CLINICAL TRIAL RECOMMENDATIONS. BIKRAM YOGA IS A STYLE OF HATHA YOGA INVOLVING A STANDARIZED SERIES OF ASANAS PERFORMED TO AN INSTRUCTIONAL DIALOGUE IN A HEATED ENVIRONMENT (40.6 DEGREES C, 40% HUMIDITY). SEVERAL STUDIES EVALUATING THE EFFECT OF BIKRAM YOGA ON HEALTH-RELATED OUTCOMES HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED OVER THE PAST DECADE. HOWEVER, TO DATE, THERE ARE NO COMPREHENSIVE REVIEWS OF THIS RESEARCH AND THERE REMAINS A LACK OF LARGE-SCALE, ROBUSTLY-DESIGNED RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCT) OF BIKRAM YOGA TRAINING. THE PURPOSE OF THIS REVIEW IS TO CONTEXTUALISE AND SUMMARISE TRIALS THAT HAVE EVALUATED THE EFFECTS OF BIKRAM YOGA ON HEALTH AND TO PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH. ACCORDING TO PUBLISHED LITERATURE, BIKRAM YOGA HAS BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE LOWER BODY STRENGTH, LOWER AND UPPER BODY RANGE OF MOTION, AND BALANCE IN HEALTHY ADULTS. NON-RCTS REPORT THAT BIKRAM YOGA MAY, IN SOME POPULATIONS, IMPROVE GLUCOSE TOLERANCE, BONE MINERAL DENSITY, BLOOD LIPID PROFILE, ARTERIAL STIFFNESS, MINDFULNESS, AND PERCEIVED STRESS. THERE IS VAST POTENTIAL FOR FURTHER, IMPROVED RESEARCH INTO THE EFFECTS OF BIKRAM YOGA, PARTICULARLY IN UNHEALTHY POPULATIONS, TO BETTER UNDERSTAND INTERVENTION-RELATED ADAPTATIONS AND THEIR INFLUENCE ON THE PROGRESSION OF CHRONIC DISEASE. FUTURE RESEARCH SHOULD ADHERE TO CONSORT GUIDELINES FOR BETTER DESIGN AND REPORTING TO IMPROVE RESEARCH QUALITY IN THIS FIELD.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
20 2072 16 THE EFFECT OF A SIX-WEEK PROGRAM OF YOGA AND MEDITATION ON BRACHIAL ARTERY REACTIVITY: DO PSYCHOSOCIAL INTERVENTIONS AFFECT VASCULAR TONE? BACKGROUND: CHRONIC STRESS IS ESTIMATED TO INCREASE THE RISK OF CARDIOVASCULAR (CV) EVENTS TWO-FOLD. ALTHOUGH STRESS REDUCTION HAS BEEN LINKED TO A REDUCTION IN CV EVENTS, LITTLE IS KNOWN REGARDING ITS EXACT MECHANISM OF BENEFIT. HYPOTHESIS: YOGA AND MEDITATION WILL IMPROVE PARAMETERS OF ENDOTHELIAL FUNCTION. METHODS: WE EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA AND MEDITATION ON HEMODYNAMIC AND LABORATORY PARAMETERS AS WELL AS ON ENDOTHELIAL FUNCTION IN A 6-WEEK PILOT STUDY. SYSTOLIC AND DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURES, HEART RATE, BODY MASS INDEX (BMI), FASTING GLUCOSE, LIPIDS, HS C-REACTIVE PROTEIN (CRP), AND ENDOTHELIAL FUNCTION (AS ASSESSED BY BRACHIAL ARTERY REACTIVITY) WERE ALL STUDIED AT BASELINE AND AFTER 6 WEEKS OF YOGA PRACTICE. RESULTS: A COURSE IN YOGA AND MEDITATION WAS GIVEN TO THE SUBJECTS FOR 1.5 H THREE TIMES WEEKLY FOR 6 WEEKS AND SUBJECTS WERE INSTRUCTED TO CONTINUE THEIR EFFORTS AT HOME. THIS PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY INCLUDED 33 SUBJECTS (MEAN AGE 55 +/- 11 YEARS) BOTH WITH (30%) AND WITHOUT (70%) ESTABLISHED CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD). THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN BLOOD PRESSURE, HEART RATE, AND BMI IN THE TOTAL COHORT WITH YOGA. NONE OF THE LABORATORY PARAMETERS CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY WITH YOGA. FOR THE TOTAL COHORT THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN ENDOTHELIAL-DEPENDENT VASODILATATION WITH YOGA TRAINING AND MEDITATION COMPARED WITH BASELINE (16.7% RELATIVE IMPROVEMENT FROM 7.2-8.4%; P = 0.3). IN THE GROUP WITH CAD, ENDOTHELIAL-DEPENDENT VASODILATATION IMPROVED 69% WITH YOGA TRAINING (6.38-10.78%; P = 0.09). CONCLUSION: YOGA AND MEDITATION APPEAR TO IMPROVE ENDOTHELIAL FUNCTION IN SUBJECTS WITH CAD.	2006

1 2070 106 THE EFFECT OF A HATHA YOGA PRACTICE ON HAMSTRING FLEXIBILITY. PURPOSE: TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF A 7-WEEK HATHA YOGA INTERVENTION ON HAMSTRINGS FLEXIBILITY USING A DIGITAL GONIOMETER. IT WAS HYPOTHESIZED THAT HAMSTRING FLEXIBILITY WILL INCREASE IN A YOUNG HEALTHY ADULT POPULATION. METHODS: THIRTY-ONE COLLEGE-AGED MALES AND FEMALES (MAGE= 21 +/- 2.62) YEARS PARTICIPATED IN 110 MINUTES TWICE PER WEEK FOR A 7-WEEK PROGRESSIVE YOGA INTERVENTION. PRE AND POST-TEST MEASUREMENTS WERE TAKEN TO DETERMINE HAMSTRING FLEXIBILITY ON THE RIGHT AND LEFT LEG USING A DIGITAL GONIOMETER. RESULTS: A PAIRED SAMPLES T-TEST INDICATED A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE PRE AND POST-TEST ON HAMSTRING FLEXIBILITY (P < .05). RESULTS FOR THE RIGHT LEG PRE-TEST (T(30) = -6.64, P <0.05, 95% CI (-6.14, -3.25), D = 0.77. P < 0.05 AS WELL AS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE LEFT PRE AND POST-ROM (T(30) = -6.93, P <0.05, 95% CI (-2.97, -6.79), D = 0.52, P < 0.05 INDICATED AN IMPROVEMENT AFTER THE INTERVENTION. AVERAGE RANGE OF MOTION INCREASE WAS 4 DEGREES IN BOTH LEGS. CONCLUSION: HAMSTRING FLEXIBILITY CAN BE IMPROVED WITH A PROGRESSIVE 7-WEEK HATHA YOGA SESSION AND MAY BE USED AS A MODALITY TO IMPROVE FLEXIBILITY AND FUNCTION IN ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING AS WELL AND ATHLETIC PERFORMANCE.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
2 2152  32 THE EFFECTS OF SELECTED ASANAS IN IYENGAR YOGA ON FLEXIBILITY: PILOT STUDY. IN RECENT YEARS THE PRACTICE OF YOGA HAS GAINED POPULARITY AS A FORM OF PHYSICAL FITNESS AND EXERCISE, AND HAS BEEN SAID TO IMPROVE STRENGTH AND FLEXIBILITY. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THIS RESEARCH PROJECT WAS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF A SIX WEEK IYENGAR YOGA INTERVENTION ON FLEXIBILITY. N = 16 LOW TO MODERATELY ACTIVE FEMALES (52.37 +/- 7.79 YEARS) ATTENDED IYENGAR YOGA PRACTICE FOR A TOTAL OF 6 WEEKS, CONSISTING OF ONE 90 MIN SESSION PER WEEK. LUMBAR AND HAMSTRING FLEXIBILITY WERE ASSESSED PRE AND POST-INTERVENTION USING A STANDARD SIT AND REACH TEST. THE RESULTS SHOW A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN FLEXIBILITY, INDICATING 6 WEEKS OF SINGLE SESSION YOGA TRAINING MAY BE EFFECTIVE IN INCREASING ERECTOR SPINAE AND HAMSTRING FLEXIBILITY. THIS IS IMPORTANT WHEN CONSIDERING THAT MUCH OF THE POPULATION FIND IT DIFFICULT TO ATTEND MORE THAN ONE SESSION A WEEK INTO THEIR TRAINING SCHEDULE.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
3 1760  33 POSITIVE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PHYSICAL AND RESPIRATORY FUNCTIONS IN HEALTHY INACTIVE MIDDLE-AGED PEOPLE. CONTEXT: YOGA IMPROVES PHYSICAL AND RESPIRATORY FUNCTIONS IN HEALTHY INACTIVE MIDDLE-AGED PEOPLE. AIM: THIS STUDY AIMED TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF 8 WEEKS OF ASANA AND ASANA WITH PRANAYAMA LESSONS IN ORDER TO CLARIFY THE INFLUENCE OF TWO DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS OF YOGA PRACTICE ON PHYSICAL AND RESPIRATORY FUNCTIONS IN HEALTHY INACTIVE MIDDLE-AGED PEOPLE. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A TOTAL OF 28 PARTICIPANTS (MEAN AGE: 52.7 YEARS) WERE DIVIDED INTO A YOGA ASANA (YA) GROUP AND YA WITH PRANAYAMA (YAP) GROUP. PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED A 70-MIN SESSION ONCE A WEEK FOR 8 WEEKS. THE YA GROUP PRACTICED BASIC ASANA WITHOUT SPECIFIC BREATHING INSTRUCTIONS, WHILE THE YAP GROUP PRACTICED BASIC ASANA WITH SPECIFIC BREATHING INSTRUCTIONS (PRANAYAMA). RESPIRATORY FUNCTION WAS MEASURED WITH AN AUTOSPIROMETER. PHYSICAL FUNCTION ASSESSMENTS INCLUDED THE 30-S CHAIR STAND TEST AND UPPER AND LOWER EXTREMITY FLEXIBILITY. ALL TESTS WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE AND AFTER 8 WEEKS OF INTERVENTION. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: CHANGES IN SCORES WERE ANALYZED WITH THE PAIRED T-TEST FOR EACH GROUP. PRE-POST RESULTS WERE COMPARED FOR ALL THE MEASURED VALUES. P < 0.05 WAS CONSIDERED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. RESULTS: BOTH GROUPS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN PHYSICAL AND OVERALL RESPIRATORY FUNCTIONS AFTER THE 8-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION. HOWEVER, THE MAXIMAL INSPIRATORY PRESSURE AND LOWER EXTREMITY FLEXIBILITY IMPROVED ONLY IN THE YAP GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: THE 8-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION FOR HEALTHY INACTIVE MIDDLE-AGED PEOPLE IMPROVED THE OVERALL RESPIRATORY AND PHYSICAL FUNCTIONS, AND THE INCLUSION OF PRANAYAMA HAD THE ADDED BENEFIT OF IMPROVING INSPIRATORY MUSCLE STRENGTH AND GLOBAL BODY FLEXIBILITY.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
4 2192  36 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA PRACTICE ON BALANCE, STRENGTH, COORDINATION AND FLEXIBILITY IN HEALTHY CHILDREN AGED 10-12YEARS. OBJECTIVE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA PRACTICE ON BALANCE, STRENGTH, COORDINATION, AND FLEXIBILITY IN HEALTHY CHILDREN AGED 10-12 YEARS. STUDY DESIGN: QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL, NONRANDOMIZED. BACKGROUND: RESEARCH ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA IN CHILDREN HAS FOCUSED ON THE BENEFITS SEEN IN NON-HEALTHY CHILDREN OR ON THE EFFECTS ON HAND GRIP STRENGTH AND MOTOR PERFORMANCE. THE STUDIES ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON BALANCE, STRENGTH, COORDINATION, AND FLEXIBILITY HAVE BEEN LIMITED. METHODS AND MEASURES: A CONVENIENCE SAMPLE OF 26 CHILDREN, AGED 10-12 YEARS WAS OBTAINED. THE CHILDREN PARTICIPATED IN 40MIN YOGA SESSIONS, LED BY A REGISTERED YOGA TEACHER, 1-3 TIMES PER WEEK FOR 8 WEEKS. THE BRUININKS-OSERETSKY TEST OF MOTOR PROFICIENCY, SECOND EDITION (BOT-2), THE SIT AND REACH TEST, AND THE 90/90 HAMSTRING FLEXIBILITY TEST WERE ADMINISTERED AT BASELINE AND AT THE END OF THE 8 WEEKS. DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS WERE CALCULATED FOR ALL MEASUREMENTS. A SHAPIRO-WILK TEST WAS USED TO TEST NORMALITY. A WILCOXIN SIGNED-RANK TEST WAS USED TO ANALYZE PRE- AND POST-TEST MEASUREMENTS FOR ALL VARIABLES. RESULTS: THERE WAS A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT WITHIN-SUBJECT DIFFERENCE FROM PRE-TEST TO POST-TEST FOR BALANCE (P=0.026), SIT AND REACH (P=0.000), POPLITEAL ANGLE RIGHT (P=0.005), AND POPLITEAL ANGLE LEFT (P=0.018). THERE WERE NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN STRENGTH AND BILATERAL COORDINATION FROM PRE-TO POST-TEST MEASUREMENTS. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA MAY BE A BENEFICIAL FORM OF EXERCISE IN THE SCHOOL-BASED SETTING FOR IMPROVING BALANCE AND FLEXIBILITY IN HEALTHY CHILDREN.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
5 2653  39 YOGA IMPROVES OCCUPATIONAL PERFORMANCE, DEPRESSION, AND DAILY ACTIVITIES FOR PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC PAIN. BACKGROUND: CHRONIC PAIN IS A COMPLEX ACCUMULATION OF PHYSICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS, THUS INTERVENTIONS THAT ADDRESS PAIN AND PROMOTE OCCUPATIONAL PERFORMANCE ARE NEEDED. A HOLISTIC INTERVENTION, WITH MIND AND BODY COMPONENTS, IS LIKELY NECESSARY TO BEST TREAT THE COMPLEXITIES OF CHRONIC PAIN. THUS, WE DEVELOPED AND TESTED A YOGA INTERVENTION FOR PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC PAIN. OBJECTIVES: IN A RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL (RCT), PARTICIPANTS WITH CHRONIC PAIN WERE RANDOMIZED TO A YOGA INTERVENTION OR USUAL CARE GROUP. BETWEEN AND WITHIN GROUP DIFFERENCES FOR PRE-AND POST-OUTCOME MEASURE SCORES WERE ASSESSED FOR: OCCUPATIONAL PERFORMANCE, COMPLETION OF ACTIVITIES, AND DEPRESSION. METHODS: PILOT RCT WITH PARTICIPANT ALLOCATION TO 8 WEEKS OF YOGA OR USUAL CARE. BOTH GROUPS RECEIVED ONGOING MONTHLY SELF-MANAGEMENT PROGRAMMING. DATA WERE COLLECTED BEFORE AND AFTER THE 8-WEEK INTERVENTION. PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO YOGA OR USUAL CARE AFTER BASELINE ASSESSMENTS. DEMOGRAPHICS WERE COLLECTED AND MEASURES INCLUDED: CANADIAN OCCUPATIONAL PERFORMANCE MEASURE (COPM) TO ASSESS OCCUPATIONAL PERFORMANCE; THE 15-ITEM FRENCHAY ACTIVITIES INDEX (FAI)(ACTIVITIES); AND THE 9-ITEM PATIENT HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE (PHQ-9) FOR DEPRESSION. INDEPENDENT T-TESTS WERE USED TO ASSESS DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GROUPS. PAIRED T-TESTS WERE USED TO ASSESS DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PRE- AND POST 8-WEEK INTERVENTION FOR BOTH THE YOGA AND THE USUAL CARE GROUPS. PERCENT CHANGE SCORES AND EFFECT SIZES WERE CALCULATED. RESULTS: 83 PEOPLE WERE RECRUITED FOR THE STUDY AND COMPLETED BASELINE ASSESSMENTS; 44 INDIVIDUALS WERE RANDOMIZED TO YOGA AND 39 TO THE CONTROL GROUP. THE AVERAGE AGE OF ALL PARTICIPANTS WAS 51.4+/-10.5 YEARS, 68% WERE FEMALE; AND 60% HAD AT LEAST SOME COLLEGE EDUCATION. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN DEMOGRAPHICS OR OUTCOME MEASURES BETWEEN GROUPS AT BASELINE OR 8 WEEKS; HOWEVER, THE STUDY WAS NOT POWERED TO SEE SUCH DIFFERENCES. INDIVIDUALS RANDOMIZED TO THE CONTROL GROUP DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE IN ANY OUTCOME MEASURE OVER THE 8 WEEKS. THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN COPM PERFORMANCE AND COPM SATISFACTION SCORES FOR INDIVIDUALS RANDOMIZED TO THE YOGA GROUP; BOTH SCORES SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED. COPM PERFORMANCE IMPROVED BY 27% WITH A MODERATE TO LARGE EFFECT SIZE (3.66+/-1.85 VS 4.66+/-1.93, P < 0.001, D = 0.76). COPM SATISFACTION SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED BY 78% (2.14+/-2.31 VS. 3.80+/-2.50, P < 0.001) AND HAD A LARGE EFFECTS SIZE (D = 1.02). FAI SCORES IMPROVED, INDICATING INCREASED ACTIVITY OR ENGAGEMENT IN DAILY OCCUPATION DURING THE 8-WEEK INTERVENTION. SCORES INCREASED BY 5% (38.13+/-8.48 VS. 39.90+/-8.57, P = 0.024) WITH A SMALL EFFECT SIZE (D = 0.37). DEPRESSION SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED FROM 13.21+/-5.60 TO 11.41+/-5.82, P = 0.041, WITH A SMALL EFFECT SIZE. CONCLUSION: DATA FROM THIS PILOT RCT INDICATE YOGA MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION WITH PEOPLE IN CHRONIC PAIN TO IMPROVE OCCUPATIONAL PERFORMANCE, INCREASE ENGAGEMENT IN ACTIVITIES, AND DECREASE DEPRESSION. OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY PRACTITIONERS MAY CONSIDER ADDING YOGA AS A TREATMENT INTERVENTION TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE WITH PAIN.	2019	

6  404  21 BIKRAM YOGA TRAINING AND PHYSICAL FITNESS IN HEALTHY YOUNG ADULTS. THERE HAS BEEN RELATIVELY LITTLE LONGITUDINAL CONTROLLED INVESTIGATION OF THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON GENERAL PHYSICAL FITNESS, DESPITE THE WIDESPREAD PARTICIPATION IN THIS FORM OF EXERCISE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS EXPLORATORY STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF SHORT-TERM BIKRAM YOGA TRAINING ON GENERAL PHYSICAL FITNESS. YOUNG HEALTHY ADULTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO YOGA TRAINING (N = 10, 29 +/- 6 YEARS, 24 SESSIONS IN 8 WEEKS) OR A CONTROL GROUP (N = 11, 26 +/- 7 YEARS). EACH YOGA TRAINING SESSION CONSISTED OF 90-MINUTE STANDARDIZED SUPERVISED POSTURES PERFORMED IN A HEATED AND HUMIDIFIED STUDIO. ISOMETRIC DEADLIFT STRENGTH, HANDGRIP STRENGTH, LOWER BACK/HAMSTRING AND SHOULDER FLEXIBILITY, RESTING HEART RATE AND BLOOD PRESSURE, MAXIMAL OXYGEN CONSUMPTION (TREADMILL), AND LEAN AND FAT MASS (DUAL-ENERGY X-RAY ABSORPTIOMETRY) WERE MEASURED BEFORE AND AFTER TRAINING. YOGA SUBJECTS EXHIBITED INCREASED DEADLIFT STRENGTH, SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED LOWER BACK/HAMSTRING FLEXIBILITY, INCREASED SHOULDER FLEXIBILITY, AND MODESTLY DECREASED BODY FAT COMPARED WITH CONTROL GROUP. THERE WERE NO CHANGES IN HANDGRIP STRENGTH, CARDIOVASCULAR MEASURES, OR MAXIMAL AEROBIC FITNESS. IN SUMMARY, THIS SHORT-TERM YOGA TRAINING PROTOCOL PRODUCED BENEFICIAL CHANGES IN MUSCULOSKELETAL FITNESS THAT WERE SPECIFIC TO THE TRAINING STIMULUS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
7  983  31 EFFECTS OF HATA YOGA ON KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS. BACKGROUND: THE PURPOSE OF THIS RESEARCH WAS TO STUDY THE EFFECTS OF 8 WEEKS OF HATA YOGA EXERCISES ON WOMEN WITH KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS. STUDIES ABOUT EFFECTS OF YOGA ON DIFFERENT CHRONIC DISEASES SHOW THAT THESE EXERCISES HAVE POSITIVE EFFECTS ON CHRONIC DISEASES. AS KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS IS VERY COMMON AMONG MIDDLE AGE WOMEN WE DECIDED TO MEASURE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE EXERCISES ON KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS. METHODS: SAMPLE INCLUDED 30 WOMEN WITH KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS WHO VOLUNTARILY PARTICIPATED IN THIS SEMI-EXPERIMENTAL STUDY AND WERE DIVIDED INTO A CONTROL GROUP (15) AND A YOGA GROUP (15). THE YOGA GROUP RECEIVED 60 MINUTES SESSIONS OF HATA YOGA, 3 TIMES A WEEK AND FOR 8 WEEKS. PAIN, SYMPTOMS, DAILY ACTIVITIES, SPORTS AND SPARE-TIME ACTIVITIES, AND QUALITY OF LIFE WERE RESPECTIVELY MEASURED BY VISUAL ANALOG SCALE (VAS) AND KNEE INJURY AND OSTEOARTHRITIS OUTCOME SCALE (KOOS) QUESTIONNAIRE. THE ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE (ANOVA) METHOD FOR REPETITIVE DATA WAS USED TO ANALYZE THE RESULTS (P = 0.05). RESULTS: FINDINGS SHOWED THAT PAIN AND SYMPTOMS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED AND SCORES OF DAILY ACTIVITIES, SPORTS, SPARE-TIME ACTIVITIES, AND QUALITY OF LIFE WERE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED IN THE YOGA GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: IT SEEMS THAT YOGA CAN BE USED AS A CONSERVATIVE TREATMENT BESIDES USUAL TREATMENTS AND MEDICATIONS TO IMPROVE THE CONDITION OF PEOPLE WITH OSTEOARTHRITIS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
8  356  40 ASSOCIATION BETWEEN HAMSTRING FLEXIBILITY AND SPRINT SPEED AFTER 8 WEEKS OF YOGA IN MALE RUGBY PLAYERS. BACKGROUND: A YOGA-ASANA-BASED INTERVENTION HAS DEMONSTRATED ITS ABILITY TO IMPROVE FLEXIBILITY OF INDIVIDUALS, BUT HAS NOT BEEN EXPLORED IN RUGBY PLAYERS. WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT A STRUCTURED YOGA INTERVENTION MAY HAVE AN EFFECT ON FLEXIBILITY AND SPRINT PERFORMANCE IN MALE RUGBY UNION PLAYERS. METHODS: IT WAS A CONTROLLED TRIAL RESEARCH DESIGN AND PLAYERS WERE ASSIGNED USING RANDOM SAMPLING TO ONE OF THE TWO GROUPS; A YOGA GROUP (N = 16) THAT PRACTISED YOGA FOR 1 H 2 TIMES A WEEK FOR 8 WEEKS IN ADDITION TO THEIR NORMAL RUGBY TRAINING AND A CONTROL GROUP (N = 15) WITH REGULAR RUGBY TRAINING BUT NO YOGA INTERVENTION. YOGA INTERVENTION INCLUDED 32 YOGA POSTURES TO ADDRESS BOTH THE UPPER AND LOWER EXTREMITIES OF THE BODY. DATA WERE COLLECTED DURING PRESEASON AND MID-SEASON ON HAMSTRING FLEXIBILITY (SIT AND REACH TEST), AND SPRINT PERFORMANCE (MEASURED AT 5, 10, AND 30 M). RESULTS: ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY PARTICIPANTS WERE SCREENED AND THIRTY-ONE PLAYERS VOLUNTEERED FOR THE STUDY. INTERACTIONS BETWEEN GROUPS AND DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PRE- AND POST-INTERVENTION SCORES WERE ANALYZED USING ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE USING SPSS (VERSION 24.0). SIGNIFICANCE WAS SET AT AN ALPHA LEVEL OF P = 0.05. THE YOGA GROUP SHOWED A SMALL NONSIGNIFICANT DECREASE (-1.2% +/- 21.4%, P = 0.05) IN HAMSTRING FLEXIBILITY COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP WHICH DEMONSTRATED A LARGE SIGNIFICANT DECREASE (-14.8% +/- 23.7%) (MEAN % CHANGE +/- 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI], P < 0.05). THE YOGA GROUP ALSO SHOWED MINOR NONSIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN SPRINT TIMES -3.2% +/- 10.4%, -0.7% +/- 9.0% FOR THE 5 AND 10 M SPRINTS, RESPECTIVELY, (MEAN % CHANGE +/- 95% CI) COMPARED TO CONTROLS -0.4% +/- 10.2%, 0.4% +/- 7.9%. CONCLUSIONS: FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT COMPLETING A STRUCTURED YOGA INTERVENTION ALONGSIDE NORMAL RUGBY TRAINING DURING THE RUGBY SEASON, YOGA HELPED RUGBY PLAYERS MAINTAIN THEIR HAMSTRING FLEXIBILITY BUT DID LITTLE TO IMPROVE SPRINT PERFORMANCE DURING THE SEASON.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
9 2103  33 THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON FUNCTIONAL RECOVERY LEVEL IN SCHIZOPHRENIC PATIENTS. PURPOSE: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON FUNCTIONAL RECOVERY LEVEL IN SCHIZOPHRENIC PATIENTS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN WITH PRETEST-POSTTEST CONTROL GROUP. THE POPULATION OF THE STUDY CONSISTED OF SCHIZOPHRENIC PATIENTS WITH REGISTERED IN MALATYA AND ELAZIG COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH CENTERS AND REGULARLY GOING TO THESE CENTERS. THE SAMPLE GROUP OF THE STUDY CONSISTED OF TOTALLY 100 PATIENTS INCLUDING 50 PATIENTS IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP AND 50 PATIENTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP WHO WERE SPECIFIED THROUGH POWER ANALYSIS AND CHOSEN BY USING RANDOM SAMPLING METHOD FROM THIS POPULATION. THE DATA WERE COLLECTED BETWEEN APRIL 2015 AND AUGUST 2015. 'PATIENT DESCRIPTION FORM' AND 'FROGS' WERE USED TO COLLECT THE DATA. YOGA WAS APPLIED TO PATIENTS IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP. ANY INTERVENTION WAS NOT MADE TO PATIENTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP. PERCENTAGE DISTRIBUTION, ARITHMETIC MEAN, STANDARD DEVIATION, CHI-SQUARE, INDEPENDENT SAMPLES T TEST, AND PAIRED T TEST WERE USED TO ASSESS THE DATA. RESULTS: PATIENTS IN THE CONTROL AND EXPERIMENTAL GROUP PRETEST SUBSCALE AND THE TOTAL MEANS SCORES OF FROGS WAS FOUND TO BE LOW. IN THE POSTTEST SUBSCALE AND TOTAL MEANS SCORES OF FROGS IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP WERE HIGHER THAN IN THE CONTROL GROUP AND THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THEM WERE FOUND TO BE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P<0.05). IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP PRETEST AND POSTTEST SUBSCALE AND TOTAL MEANS SCORES OF FR0GS WAS DETERMINED TO BE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: YOGA THAT APPLIED TO SCHIZOPHRENIC PATIENTS IT WAS DETERMINED TO INCREASED THE LEVEL OF FUNCTIONAL RECOVERY. IT CAN BE SUGGESTED THAT YOGA SHOULD BE USED AS AN COMPLEMENTARY METHOD IN NURSING PRACTISE IN ORDER TO INCREASE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE TREATMENT.	2016

11  943  30 EFFECTS OF A 12-WEEK HATHA YOGA INTERVENTION ON CARDIORESPIRATORY ENDURANCE, MUSCULAR STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE, AND FLEXIBILITY IN HONG KONG CHINESE ADULTS: A CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL. OBJECTIVE. TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF A 12-WEEK HATHA YOGA INTERVENTION ON CARDIORESPIRATORY ENDURANCE, MUSCULAR STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE, AND FLEXIBILITY IN CHINESE ADULTS. METHODS. 173 ADULTS (AGED 52.0 +/- 7.5 YEARS) WERE ASSIGNED TO EITHER THE YOGA INTERVENTION GROUP (N = 87) OR THE WAITLIST CONTROL GROUP (N = 86). 19 DROPPED OUT FROM THE STUDY. PRIMARY OUTCOMES WERE CHANGES IN CARDIORESPIRATORY ENDURANCE (RESTING HEART RATE (HR) AND MAXIMAL OXYGEN UPTAKE (VO2MAX)), MUSCULAR STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE (CURL-UP AND PUSH-UP TESTS), AND LOWER BACK AND HAMSTRING FLEXIBILITY (THE MODIFIED BACK-SAVER SIT-AND-REACH (MBS) TEST). RESULTS. COMPARED TO CONTROLS, THE YOGA GROUP ACHIEVED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN VO2MAX (P < 0.01), CURL-UP (P < 0.05) AND PUSH-UP (P < 0.001) TESTS, AND THE MBS LEFT AND RIGHT LEG TESTS (BOTH P < 0.001) IN BOTH GENDERS. SIGNIFICANT CHANGE WAS ALSO FOUND FOR RESTING HR BETWEEN GROUPS IN WOMEN (P < 0.05) BUT NOT IN MEN. FURTHER ANALYSIS COMPARING PARTICIPANTS BETWEEN YOUNGER AND OLDER SUBGROUPS YIELDED SIMILAR FINDINGS, EXCEPT THAT THE OLDER PARTICIPANTS IN THE YOGA GROUP FAILED TO IMPROVE RESTING HR OR THE CURL-UP TEST VERSUS CONTROL. ADHERENCE (89%) AND ATTENDANCE (94%) WERE HIGH. NO SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS OCCURRED. CONCLUSION. A 12-WEEK HATHA YOGA INTERVENTION HAS FAVORABLE EFFECTS ON CARDIORESPIRATORY ENDURANCE, MUSCULAR STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE, AND FLEXIBILITY IN CHINESE ADULTS.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
12 2833  27 YOGA'S EFFECT ON FALLS IN RURAL, OLDER ADULTS. BACKGROUND: UNINTENTIONAL FALLS AFFECT 30% OF PEOPLE OVER AGE 65 YEARS. YOGA HAS BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE BALANCE. WE DESIGNED THIS STUDY TO EXAMINE IF YOGA REDUCES FALLS. METHODS: WE CONDUCTED 16 SESSIONS OF HATHA YOGA OVER 8 WEEKS. PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO PRACTICE 10MIN OF YOGA DAILY AT HOME IN ADDITION TO 5-MIN RELAXATION EXERCISES OR RELAXATION EXERCISES ONLY (CONTROL GROUP). RESULTS: OF THE 38 PARTICIPANTS COMPLETING THE INTERVENTION, 15 PARTICIPANTS REPORTED A TOTAL OF 27 FALLS IN THE 6-MONTHS BEFORE THE STUDY, COMPARED TO 13 PARTICIPANTS SUSTAINING 14 FALLS IN THE 6 MONTHS FROM THE START OF THE STUDY (P<0.047), WITHOUT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOGA HOME-EXERCISE AND HOME RELAXATION-ONLY GROUPS. COMPARED TO BASELINE SCORES, ALL PARTICIPANTS IMPROVED ON THE BERG BALANCE SCALE (53-54 OUT OF 56, P=0.002), THE FUNCTIONAL GAIT ASSESSMENT (22.9-25.8 OUT OF 30 POINTS, P<0.001), AND THE DYNAMIC GAIT INDEX (20.6-22.4 OUT OF 24 POINTS, P<0.001). RIGHT LEG STAND TIME IMPROVED FROM A MEAN OF 13.3S TO 17.1S (P=0.020) AND STANDING FORWARD REACH DISTANCE FROM 26.0CM TO 29.6CM (P<0.001). WITHOUT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROUPS. CONFIDENCE, WITH THE ACTIVITIES-SPECIFIC BALANCE CONFIDENCE SCALE, INCREASED IN THE YOGA HOME-EXERCISE GROUP (88%-93%, P=0.037) COMPARED TO 90% UNCHANGED FROM PRE-INTERVENTION IN THE HOME RELAXATION-ONLY GROUP. CONCLUSION: YOGA CLASSES REDUCE SELF-REPORTED FALLS AND IMPROVE BALANCE MEASURES. THE ADDITION OF HOME YOGA EXERCISES DID NOT ENHANCE BENEFIT OVER RELAXATION EXERCISE ONLY.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
13 1301  32 HATHA YOGA ON BODY BALANCE. BACKGROUND: A GOOD BODY BALANCE REQUIRES A PROPER FUNCTION OF VESTIBULAR, VISUAL, AND SOMATOSENSORY SYSTEMS WHICH CAN BE REACH WITH EXERCISE PRACTICE AND/OR YOGA. AIM: TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTS OF A 5-MONTH HATHA YOGA TRAINING PROGRAM ON BODY BALANCE IN YOUNG ADULTS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THIS STUDY USED A CONTROLLED, NONRANDOMIZED DESIGN, WHERE THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP UNDERWENT A 5-MONTH TRAINING PROGRAM AND WERE THEN COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP THAT HAD A SEDENTARY LIFESTYLE. A CONVENIENCE SAMPLE OF 34 OUT OF 40 MEN AGED 25-55 YEARS OLD (34.0 +/- 0.9) WERE DEEMED ELIGIBLE FOR THIS STUDY. THEY WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS: EXPERIMENTAL AND CONTROL GROUPS. SUBJECTS IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP WERE ENGAGED IN 60 MIN SESSIONS OF HATHA YOGA THREE TIMES A WEEK FOR 5 MONTHS. WE EVALUATED POSTURAL CONTROL BY MEASURING THE LIMIT OF STABILITY AND VELOCITY OF OSCILLATION (VOS) IN THREE CONDITIONS OF THE BALANCE REHABILITATION UNIT (BRU) AND THROUGH FIELD PROCEDURES (FOUR POSITION, PLANE, FLAMINGO, HOPSCOTCH, AND DYNAMIC TEST). RESULTS: WE OBSERVED DIFFERENCES (P < 0.05) IN POSTINTERVENTION SCORES BETWEEN THE GROUPS REGARDLESS OF BRU PARAMETERS AND FIELD PROCEDURES (EXCEPT FOR FLAMINGO) EVEN AFTER ADJUSTING FOR PREINTERVENTION SCORES, SUGGESTING THAT THESE CHANGES WERE INDUCED BY HATHA YOGA TRAINING. THE PARTIAL ETA SQUARED ON BRU PARAMETERS RANGED FROM 0.78 (VOS1)-0.97 (COP2), AND FROM 0.00 (FLAMINGO)-0.94 (FOUR POSITION) FOR THE FIELD PROCEDURES. CONCLUSIONS: OUR RESULTS PROVIDE SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE THAT POSTURAL CONTROL IN HEALTHY YOUNG ADULTS CAN BE IMPROVED THROUGH PRACTICING HATHA YOGA.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
14  987  36 EFFECTS OF HATHA YOGA EXERCISES ON SPINE FLEXIBILITY IN WOMEN OVER 50 YEARS OLD. [PURPOSE] THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ACCESS THE FLEXIBILITY OF THE SPINE IN WOMEN PRACTICING YOGA AS A PART OF THE "UNIVERSITY FOR HEALTH" PROJECT. [SUBJECTS AND METHODS] THE STUDY INCLUDED 56 WOMEN RANGING IN AGE BETWEEN 50-79 AND ATTENDING 90 MINUTES HATHA YOGA SESSIONS ONCE A WEEK. THE MEASUREMENTS WERE PERFORMED TWICE-AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PROJECT AND AFTER ITS COMPLETION, I.E., AFTER 20 WEEKS OF CLASSES. THE RANGE OF SPINE MOBILITY IN THREE PLANES WAS MEASURED USING A RIPPSTEIN PLURIMETER. THE RANGE OF MOTION IN THE SAGITTAL AND FRONTAL PLANES WAS MEASURED IN A STANDING POSITION WITH THE FEET HIP-WIDTH APART. THE TORSIONAL RANGE OF MOTION OF THE SUBJECTS WAS MEASURED WITH THE TRUNK BENT AT A RIGHT ANGLE AND THE LEGS APART. THE FLEXIBILITY RANGES OF THE SPINE AND HAMSTRINGS WERE ALSO MEASURED BY THE TOE-TOUCH TEST IN A STANDING POSITION. [RESULTS] THIS STUDY SHOWED THAT THE APPLIED YOGA EXERCISES INCREASED SPINAL MOBILITY AND FLEXIBILITY OF THE HAMSTRING MUSCLES REGARDLESS OF AGE. [CONCLUSION] YOGA EXERCISES SHOULD BE RECOMMENDED TO THE ELDERLY TO MAKE THEIR MUSCLES MORE FLEXIBLE AND TO INCREASE THE RANGE OF MOTION IN THE JOINTS, WHICH IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR IMPROVING THEIR LIFE QUALITY.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
15  771  28 EFFECT OF YOGA AND AEROBICS EXERCISE ON SLEEP QUALITY IN WOMEN WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS INVESTIGATING THE EFFECT OF 12 WEEKS OF YOGA AND AEROBIC EXERCISE (RUNNING ON A TREADMILL) ON THE SLEEP QUALITY IN WOMEN WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 39 DIABETIC WOMEN WERE SELECTED FROM SEMNAN CITY WITH THE MEAN AGE OF 46.85+/-3.35 YEARS, WEIGHT OF 69.79+/-17.18 KG, HEIGHT OF 155.03+/-5.00, BMI OF 29.64+/-5.00 KG/M(2) WHO HAD A BACKGROUND OF DIABETES FOR 6.46+/-2.69 YEARS. THEY WERE THEN RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO YOGA EXERCISE (N=15), AEROBIC EXERCISE (N=13), AND CONTROL GROUP (N=11). THE EXERCISE PROGRAM WAS PERFORMED FOR 12 WEEKS, THREE SESSIONS PER EACH WEEK. IN ORDER TO MEASURE THE SLEEP QUALITY, THE PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX (PSQI) WAS USED. THE DATA WERE ANALYZED BY NON-PARAMETRIC WILCOXON AND KRUSKAL-WALLIS TEST AT SIGNIFICANCE LEVEL OF P<0.05. RESULTS: OVERALL SCORE OF SLEEP QUALITY IMPROVED AFTER SIX (P=0.001) AND 12 (P=0.001) WEEKS OF YOGA EXERCISE. ALSO, SIGNIFICANT EFFECT WAS OBSERVED AFTER 6 WEEKS OF AEROBIC EXERCISE (P=0.039). HOWEVER, THE POSITIVE EFFECT WAS DIMINISHED TO UNDER SIGNIFICANT LEVELS AFTER 12 WEEKS OF AEROBIC EXERCISE (P=0.154). KRUSKAL-WALLIS TEST SHOWED SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN YOGA AND AEROBIC GROUPS AFTER 12 WEEKS OF EXERCISE (P=0.002). NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE OBSERVED IN CONTROL GROUPS IN ALL SITUATION. CONCLUSIONS: IT CAN BE CONCLUDED THAT YOGA EXERCISE IS MORE EFFECTIVE IN IMPROVING THE SLEEP QUALITY IN COMPARISON WITH THE SAME COURSE OF AEROBIC EXERCISE IN WOMEN SUFFERING FROM DIABETES TYPE 2. THUS, YOGA EXERCISE CAN BE SUGGESTED TO THESE PATIENTS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
16 2073  29 THE EFFECT OF A STRETCH AND STRENGTH-BASED YOGA EXERCISE PROGRAM ON PATIENTS WITH NEUROPATHIC PAIN DUE TO LUMBAR DISC HERNIATION. STUDY DESIGN: RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF A STRETCH AND STRENGTHBASED YOGA EXERCISE PROGRAM ON NEUROPATHIC PAIN DUE TO LDH. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: LDH WITH NEUROPATHIC PAIN INFLUENCES TREATMENT OUTCOMES NEGATIVELY. MOST YOGA POSES INCLUDE THE PARAMETERS OF SPINAL TRAINING AND HELP REDUCE PAIN AND DISABILITY IN PATIENTS WITH LOW BACK INJURIES. WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT YOGA POSITIVELY AFFECTS BOTH LDH AND NEUROPATHIC PAIN BY INCREASING MOBILIZATION, CORE MUSCLE STRENGTH, AND SPINAL AND HAMSTRING FLEXIBILITY. METHODS: IN TOTAL, 48 PATIENTS WITH NEUROPATHIC PAIN DUE TO LDH WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO A CONTROL GROUP AND A YOGA GROUP. ALL PATIENTS UNDERWENT A PATIENT EDUCATION PROGRAM. IN ADDITION, THE SELECTED YOGA EXERCISE WAS TAUGHT AND PERFORMED TO THE YOGA GROUP FOR ONE HOUR TWICE WEEKLY FOR 12 WEEKS. NEUROPATHIC PAIN (DOULEUR NEUROPATHIQUE 4 FOR DIAGNOSIS; LEEDS ASSESSMENT OF NEUROPATHIC SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS FOR SEVERITY), LOW BACK PAIN (THE SHORT-FORM OF MCGILL PAIN QUESTIONNAIRE), DISABILITY (OSWESTRY DISABILITY INDEX), AND FUNCTION (MODIFIED SCHOBER AND PASSIVE KNEE EXTENSION TEST) WERE MEASURED BLIND BEFORE AND AT THE ONE-, THREE-, AND SIX-MONTH FOLLOW-UPS. THE PATIENT GLOBAL ASSESSMENT WAS APPLIED AT THE SIX-MONTH FOLLOWUP. THE INTENTION-TO-TREAT ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED IN THIS STUDY. RESULTS: THE INTENTION-TO-TREAT ANALYSIS SHOWED A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN NEUROPATHIC PAIN, PATIENT GLOBAL ASSESS MENT, LOW BACK PAIN, DISABILITY, AND FUNCTION IN FAVOR OF THE YOGA GROUP AT POST-TREATMENT. THE BETWEEN-GROUP EFFECT SIZES WERE MODERATE AT SIX-MONTHS FOLLOW-UP. CONCLUSION: IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE SELECTED STRETCH AND STRENGTH-BASED YOGA EXERCISE COULD BE A PROMISING TREATMENT OPTION FOR NEUROPATHIC PAIN DUE TO LDH.

17 2707  35 YOGA IS AS GOOD AS STRETCHING-STRENGTHENING EXERCISES IN IMPROVING FUNCTIONAL FITNESS OUTCOMES: RESULTS FROM A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: DESPITE YOGA'S POPULARITY, FEW CLINICAL TRIALS HAVE EMPLOYED RIGOROUS METHODOLOGY TO SYSTEMATICALLY EXPLORE ITS FUNCTIONAL BENEFITS COMPARED WITH MORE ESTABLISHED FORMS OF EXERCISE. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO COMPARE THE FUNCTIONAL BENEFITS OF YOGA WITH THE CONVENTIONAL STRETCHING-STRENGTHENING EXERCISES RECOMMENDED FOR ADULTS. METHODS: SEDENTARY HEALTHY ADULTS (N = 118; M AGE = 62.0) PARTICIPATED IN AN 8-WEEK (THREE TIMES A WEEK FOR 1 HOUR) RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL, WHICH CONSISTED OF A HATHA YOGA GROUP (N = 61) AND A STRETCHING-STRENGTHENING EXERCISE GROUP (N = 57). STANDARDIZED FUNCTIONAL FITNESS TESTS ASSESSING BALANCE, STRENGTH, FLEXIBILITY, AND MOBILITY WERE ADMINISTERED AT BASELINE AND POSTINTERVENTION. RESULTS: A REPEATED MEASURES MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT TIME EFFECT FOR MEASURES OF BALANCE [F(3,18) = 4.88, P < .01, PARTIAL ETA(2) = .45], STRENGTH [F(2,19) = 15.37, P < .001, PARTIAL ETA(2) = .62], FLEXIBILITY [F(4,17) = 8.86, P < .001, PARTIAL ETA(2) = .68], AND MOBILITY [F(2,19) = 8.54, P < .002, PARTIAL ETA(2) = .47]. BOTH GROUPS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS ON MEASURES OF BALANCE (LEFT-RIGHT LEG AND FOUR SQUARE STEP); STRENGTH (CHAIR STANDS AND ARM CURLS); FLEXIBILITY (BACK SCRATCH AND SIT-AND-REACH); AND MOBILITY (GAIT SPEED AND 8-FEET UP AND GO), WITH PARTIAL ETA(2) RANGING FROM .05 TO .47. CONCLUSIONS: THESE DATA SUGGEST THAT REGULAR YOGA PRACTICE IS JUST AS EFFECTIVE AS STRETCHING-STRENGTHENING EXERCISES IN IMPROVING FUNCTIONAL FITNESS. TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, THIS IS THE FIRST STUDY TO EXAMINE FUNCTIONAL BENEFITS OF YOGA IN COMPARISON WITH STRETCHING-STRENGTHENING EXERCISES IN SEDENTARY, HEALTHY, COMMUNITY-DWELLING OLDER ADULTS. THESE FINDINGS HAVE CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS AS YOGA IS A MORE AMENABLE FORM OF EXERCISE THAN STRENGTHENING EXERCISES AS IT REQUIRES MINIMAL EQUIPMENT AND CAN BE ADAPTED FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH LOWER LEVELS OF FUNCTIONING OR DISABILITIES.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
18 2576  31 YOGA FOR FUNCTIONAL FITNESS IN ADULTS WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. BACKGROUND: YOGA IS AN EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION TO IMPROVE FUNCTIONAL FITNESS IN ADULTS WITH AND WITHOUT DISABILITIES, BUT LITTLE RESEARCH EXISTS REGARDING YOGA'S IMPACT ON FUNCTIONAL FITNESS FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES (IDDS). AIMS: THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE THE BENEFITS OF A GROUP YOGA INTERVENTION ON THE FUNCTIONAL FITNESS OF ADULTS WITH IDDS. METHODS AND MATERIALS: THIS YOGA INTERVENTION INCLUDED 12 SESSIONS OF YOGA OVER 7 WEEKS (60-MIN SESSIONS TWICE A WEEK) AT A SPECIAL POPULATION RECREATION AND LEISURE PROGRAM. THE FUNCTIONAL FITNESS TEST WAS USED TO EXAMINE PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING BEFORE AND AFTER THE YOGA INTERVENTION. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: EIGHT ADULTS COMPLETED THE BASELINE AND POSTTEST MEASURES (AGE MEAN = 31; STANDARD DEVIATION = 6.55; 50% MALE). THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN LOWER-BODY STRENGTH (9.00 +/- 4.63 VS. 11.50 +/- 3.16, P = 0.04, 28% IMPROVEMENT), UPPER-BODY STRENGTH (11.25 +/- 3.54 VS. 14.25 +/- 3.37, P = 0.018, 27% IMPROVEMENT), AND AGILITY AND BALANCE (9.29 +/- 4.1 VS. 6.60 +/- 1.54, P = 0.036, 29% IMPROVEMENT). FUNCTIONAL FITNESS OFTEN DECLINES FOR PEOPLE WITH IDD AT A FASTER RATE THAN THE GENERAL POPULATION; THUS, THESE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES INDICATE THAT A YOGA INTERVENTION MAY ENHANCE FUNCTIONAL FITNESS FOR PEOPLE WITH IDD. CLINICIANS OR OTHER HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS MIGHT CONSIDER YOGA AS A MEANS TO IMPROVE FUNCTIONAL FITNESS IN ADULTS WITH IDDS.	2020

20 2825  27 YOGA VERSUS HOME EXERCISE PROGRAM IN CHILDREN WITH ENTHESITIS RELATED ARTHRITIS: A PILOT STUDY. PURPOSE: THE AIM WAS TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA AND HOME EXERCISE PROGRAM ON LOWER EXTREMITY FUNCTIONAL STATUS, PAIN, AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN CHILDREN WITH ENTHESITIS RELATED ARTHRITIS (ERA). METHODS: TWENTY-ONE CHILDREN WITH ERA WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS AS YOGA (N = 11) AND HOME EXERCISE (N = 10). YOGA GROUP PERFORMED SUPERVISED YOGA EXERCISES TWICE A WEEK FOR EIGHT WEEKS. HOME EXERCISE GROUP PERFORMED VIDEO-BASED EXERCISES FOR THE SAME PERIOD. PAIN IN REST AND ACTIVITY, LOWER EXTREMITY FUNCTIONAL STATUS, AND QUALITY OF LIFE WERE EVALUATED AT BASELINE AND FOLLOWING EIGHT WEEKS. RESULTS: THE GROUPS WERE SIMILAR AT BASELINE (P > 0.05). ALL THE PARAMETERS, EXCEPT PARENT REPORTED QUALITY OF LIFE, SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED IN YOGA GROUP (P < 0.05), WHERE ONLY STAIR CLIMB TEST TIMES SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED IN HOME EXERCISE GROUP (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: YOGA SEEMS PROMISING FOR IMPROVING LOWER EXTREMITY FUNCTIONAL STATUS, PAIN, AND QUALITY OF LIFE AS AN EXERCISE INTERVENTION IN REHABILITATION PROGRAMS OF CHILDREN WITH ERA.	2021

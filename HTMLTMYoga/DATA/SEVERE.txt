1 2425 122 YOGA AND NATUROPATHY INTERVENTION FOR REDUCING ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION OF COVID-19 PATIENTS - A PILOT STUDY. BACKGROUND: CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 (COVID-19) INFECTION HAS CAUSED A PROMINENT PSYCHOLOGICAL AND MENTAL HAVOC AMONG THE PATIENTS. TILL NOW, THERE IS PAUCITY IN LITERATURE FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS AMONG PATIENTS WITH COVID-19. SO WE AIMED IN OUR STUDY TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF YOGA AND NATUROPATHY INTERVENTION ON ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION OF COVID-19 PATIENTS. METHODS: THIS QUASI EXPERIMENTAL STUDY WAS CONDUCTED AMONG 130 COVID-19 POSITIVE PATIENTS ADMITTED IN A TERTIARY CARE HOSPITAL. YOGA AND NATUROPATHIC INTERVENTION WAS GIVEN FOR 60 MIN A DAY FOR TWO WEEKS. HOSPITAL ANXIETY DEPRESSION SCALE (HADS) AND CORONA ANXIETY SCALE (CAS) WAS USED TO ASSESS THE GENERALIZED ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION AMONG THE PATIENTS. RESULTS: AVERAGE AGE OF THE PATIENTS PARTICIPATED WAS 44 WITH THE RANGE FROM 36 TO 53 YEARS. AMONG THEM 85 WERE MALE AND 45 WERE FEMALE. OF ALL 130 PATIENTS, 33% HAD SYMPTOMS OF BORDERLINE DEPRESSION, 9.2% HAD SEVERE DEPRESSION, 40% HAD BORDERLINE ANXIETY AND 12.3% HAD SEVERE ANXIETY. IN CAS, 59 PATIENTS (45.38%) REPORTED COVID-19 RELATED DYSFUNCTIONAL ANXIETY. ALL THE PATIENTS SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE HADS- ANXIETY (P < 0.01), HADS-DEPRESSION (P < 0.01) AND CAS (P < 0.01) SCORE AFTER THE INTERVENTION. CONCLUSION: THE PRESENT STUDY SHOWED SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION OF ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION LEVEL AMONG THE COVID-19 PATIENTS. THESE INTERVENTIONS CAN BE ADDED TO THE CONVENTIONAL CARE FOR BETTER MENTAL AND PHYSICAL WELLBEING OF THE PATIENTS AFTER VALIDATING THE FINDINGS WITH JUSTIFIED STUDY DESIGN.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
2   85  30 A MINDFUL YOGA INTERVENTION FOR CHILDREN WITH SEVERE ASTHMA: A PILOT STUDY. INTRODUCTION: CHILDREN WITH SEVERE ASTHMA MAY BENEFIT FROM NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL APPROACHES TO SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT, YET LITTLE IS KNOWN REGARDING THE IMPACT OF MIND-BODY APPROACHES SUCH AS MINDFUL YOGA IN THIS POPULATION. THIS PILOT STUDY EXAMINED THE TOLERABILITY, FEASIBILITY, ACCEPTABILITY AND IMMEDIATE EFFECTS OF A MINDFUL YOGA INTERVENTION IN CHILDREN WITH SEVERE ASTHMA. METHOD: FIFTEEN CHILDREN AGES 7-11 WITH SEVERE ASTHMA PARTICIPATED IN A SINGLE MINDFUL YOGA SESSION, FOLLOWED BY SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WITH THE CHILD AND CAREGIVER. VITAL SIGNS AND PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS WERE COLLECTED PRE- AND POST-INTERVENTION. RESULTS: ALL CHILDREN REPORTED POSITIVE EXPERIENCES AND CAREGIVERS WERE GENERALLY SUPPORTIVE OF THEIR PARTICIPATION. ONE CHILD EXPERIENCED SELF-LIMITED BRONCHOCONSTRICTION WITH ASTHMA SYMPTOMS. THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN LUNG FUNCTION OR VITAL SIGNS AFTER THE MINDFUL YOGA SESSION. DISCUSSION: OUR RESULTS WARRANT ADDITIONAL LARGER STUDIES TO EVALUATE THE SAFETY AND BENEFITS OF MINDFUL YOGA IN CHILDREN WITH SEVERE ASTHMA.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
3 2631  20 YOGA FOR THE TREATMENT OF INSOMNIA AMONG CANCER PATIENTS: EVIDENCE, MECHANISMS OF ACTION, AND CLINICAL RECOMMENDATIONS. UP TO 90% OF CANCER PATIENTS REPORT SYMPTOMS OF INSOMNIA DURING AND AFTER TREATMENT. SYMPTOMS OF INSOMNIA INCLUDE EXCESSIVE DAYTIME SLEEPINESS, DIFFICULTY FALLING ASLEEP, DIFFICULTY STAYING ASLEEP, AND WAKING UP TOO EARLY. INSOMNIA SYMPTOMS ARE AMONG THE MOST PREVALENT, DISTRESSING AND PERSISTENT CANCER- AND CANCER TREATMENT-RELATED TOXICITIES REPORTED BY PATIENTS, AND CAN BE SEVERE ENOUGH TO INCREASE CANCER MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY. DESPITE THE UBIQUITY OF INSOMNIA SYMPTOMS, THEY ARE UNDER-SCREENED, UNDER-DIAGNOSED, AND UNDER-TREATED IN CANCER PATIENTS. WHEN INSOMNIA SYMPTOMS ARE IDENTIFIED, PROVIDERS ARE HESITANT TO PRESCRIBE, AND PATIENTS ARE HESITANT TO TAKE PHARMACEUTICALS DUE TO POLYPHARMACY CONCERNS. IN ADDITION, SLEEP MEDICATIONS DO NOT CURE INSOMNIA. YOGA IS A WELL-TOLERATED MODE OF EXERCISE WITH PROMISING EVIDENCE FOR ITS EFFICACY IN IMPROVING INSOMNIA SYMPTOMS AMONG CANCER PATIENTS. THIS ARTICLE REVIEWS EXISTING CLINICAL RESEARCH ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA FOR TREATING INSOMNIA AMONG CANCER PATIENTS. THE ARTICLE ALSO PROVIDES CLINICAL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRESCRIBING YOGA FOR THE TREATMENT OF INSOMNIA IN THIS POPULATION.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
4 2412  22 YOGA AND ITS IMPACT ON CHRONIC INFLAMMATORY AUTOIMMUNE ARTHRITIS. RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS (RA) IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON CHRONIC INFLAMMATORY AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES, WHICH ADVERSELY AFFECTS THE QUALITY OF LIFE. RA IS A DISEASE OF UNKNOWN ETIOLOGY, HOWEVER, BOTH GENETIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS APPEAR TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE SUSCEPTIBILITY TO THIS DISEASE. THE SEVERITY AND PROGRESSION OF THE DISEASE ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE RELEASE OF A HOST OF INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES, CYTOTOXIC AND IMMUNE REGULATORY FACTORS. THE TREATMENTS OF RA ARE PRIMARILY LIMITED TO SYMPTOMATIC ALLEVIATION OF PAIN OR OTHER SYMPTOMS OR TO THE USE OF CYTOTOXIC DRUG TREATMENT IN SEVERE FORMS OF THE DISEASE WHICH IS COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH SIGNIFICANT SIDE EFFECTS. DESPITE LACK OF A CURE, THE DISEASE MAY BE CONTROLLED BY MIND-BODY INTERVENTIONS. HOLISTIC TREATMENTS SUCH AS YOGA SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE AND REDUCE THE PSYCHO-SOMATIC SYMPTOMS, PAIN PERCEPTION, DISABILITY QUOTIENT, JOINT FLEXIBILITY, RANGE OF MOTION, POSTURE, MUSCLE STRENGTH, COORDINATION, AND DISEASE ACTIVITY. HERE, WE DISCUSS THE FEATURES OF RA AND ADDRESS HOW YOGA CAN BE USED AS A THERAPEUTIC REGIMEN TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF PATIENTS WITH RA.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
5   78  34 A LARGE-SCALE SURVEY OF ADVERSE EVENTS EXPERIENCED IN YOGA CLASSES. BACKGROUND: YOGA IS A REPRESENTATIVE MIND-BODY THERAPY OF COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE. IN JAPAN, YOGA IS PRACTICED WIDELY TO PROMOTE HEALTH, BUT YOGA-ASSOCIATED ADVERSE EVENTS HAVE ALSO BEEN REPORTED. TO DATE, THE FREQUENCIES AND CHARACTERISTICS OF YOGA-RELATED ADVERSE EVENTS HAVE NOT BEEN ELUCIDATED. THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO ELUCIDATE THE FREQUENCIES AND CHARACTERISTICS OF ADVERSE EVENTS OF YOGA PERFORMED IN CLASSES AND THE RISK FACTORS OF SUCH EVENTS. METHODS: THE SUBJECTS WERE 2508 PEOPLE TAKING YOGA CLASSES AND 271 YOGA THERAPISTS CONDUCTING THE CLASSES. A SURVEY FOR YOGA CLASS ATTENDEES WAS PERFORMED ON ADVERSE EVENTS THAT OCCURRED DURING A YOGA CLASS ON THE SURVEY DAY. A SURVEY FOR YOGA THERAPISTS WAS PERFORMED ON ADVERSE EVENTS THAT THE THERAPISTS HAD OBSERVED IN THEIR STUDENTS TO DATE. ADVERSE EVENTS WERE DEFINED AS "UNDESIRABLE SYMPTOMS OR RESPONSES THAT OCCURRED DURING A YOGA CLASS". RESULTS: AMONG 2508 YOGA CLASS ATTENDEES, 1343 (53.5%) HAD CHRONIC DISEASES AND 1063 (42.3%) WERE RECEIVING MEDICATION AT HOSPITALS. THERE WERE 687 CLASS ATTENDEES (27.8%) WHO REPORTED SOME TYPE OF UNDESIRABLE SYMPTOMS AFTER TAKING A YOGA CLASS. MUSCULOSKELETAL SYMPTOMS SUCH AS MYALGIA WERE THE MOST COMMON SYMPTOMS, INVOLVING 297 CASES, FOLLOWED BY NEUROLOGICAL SYMPTOMS AND RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS. MOST ADVERSE EVENTS (63.8%) WERE MILD AND DID NOT INTERFERE WITH CLASS PARTICIPATION. THE RISK FACTORS FOR ADVERSE EVENTS WERE EXAMINED, AND THE ODDS RATIOS FOR ADVERSE EVENTS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN ATTENDEES WITH CHRONIC DISEASE, POOR PHYSICAL CONDITION ON THE SURVEY DAY, OR A FEELING THAT THE CLASS WAS PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY STRESSFUL. IN PARTICULAR, THE OCCURRENCE OF SEVERE ADVERSE EVENTS THAT INTERFERED WITH SUBSEQUENT YOGA PRACTICE WAS HIGH AMONG ELDERLY PARTICIPANTS (70 YEARS OR OLDER) AND THOSE WITH CHRONIC MUSCULOSKELETAL DISEASES. CONCLUSIONS: THE RESULTS OF THIS LARGE-SCALE SURVEY DEMONSTRATED THAT APPROXIMATELY 30% OF YOGA CLASS ATTENDEES HAD EXPERIENCED SOME TYPE OF ADVERSE EVENT. ALTHOUGH THE MAJORITY HAD MILD SYMPTOMS, THE SURVEY RESULTS INDICATED THAT ATTENDEES WITH CHRONIC DISEASES WERE MORE LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE ADVERSE EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR DISEASE. THEREFORE, SPECIAL ATTENTION IS NECESSARY WHEN YOGA IS INTRODUCED TO PATIENTS WITH STRESS-RELATED, CHRONIC DISEASES.	2015	

6 1650  36 MULTICENTER, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF YOGA FOR SLEEP QUALITY AMONG CANCER SURVIVORS. PURPOSE: THIRTY PERCENT TO 90% OF CANCER SURVIVORS REPORT IMPAIRED SLEEP QUALITY POST-TREATMENT, WHICH CAN BE SEVERE ENOUGH TO INCREASE MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY. LIFESTYLE INTERVENTIONS, SUCH AS EXERCISE, ARE RECOMMENDED IN CONJUNCTION WITH DRUGS AND COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY FOR THE TREATMENT OF IMPAIRED SLEEP. PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT YOGA-A MIND-BODY PRACTICE AND FORM OF EXERCISE-MAY IMPROVE SLEEP AMONG CANCER SURVIVORS. THE PRIMARY AIM OF THIS RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL WAS TO DETERMINE THE EFFICACY OF A STANDARDIZED YOGA INTERVENTION COMPARED WITH STANDARD CARE FOR IMPROVING GLOBAL SLEEP QUALITY (PRIMARY OUTCOME) AMONG POST-TREATMENT CANCER SURVIVORS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: IN ALL, 410 SURVIVORS SUFFERING FROM MODERATE OR GREATER SLEEP DISRUPTION BETWEEN 2 AND 24 MONTHS AFTER SURGERY, CHEMOTHERAPY, AND/OR RADIATION THERAPY WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO STANDARD CARE OR STANDARD CARE PLUS THE 4-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION. THE YOGA INTERVENTION USED THE YOGA FOR CANCER SURVIVORS (YOCAS) PROGRAM CONSISTING OF PRANAYAMA (BREATHING EXERCISES), 16 GENTLE HATHA AND RESTORATIVE YOGA ASANAS (POSTURES), AND MEDITATION. PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED TWO 75-MINUTE SESSIONS PER WEEK. SLEEP QUALITY WAS ASSESSED BY USING THE PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX AND ACTIGRAPHY PRE- AND POSTINTERVENTION. RESULTS: IN ALL, 410 SURVIVORS WERE ACCRUED (96% FEMALE; MEAN AGE, 54 YEARS; 75% HAD BREAST CANCER). YOGA PARTICIPANTS DEMONSTRATED GREATER IMPROVEMENTS IN GLOBAL SLEEP QUALITY AND, SECONDARILY, SUBJECTIVE SLEEP QUALITY, DAYTIME DYSFUNCTION, WAKE AFTER SLEEP ONSET, SLEEP EFFICIENCY, AND MEDICATION USE AT POSTINTERVENTION (ALL P </= .05) COMPARED WITH STANDARD CARE PARTICIPANTS. CONCLUSION: YOGA, SPECIFICALLY THE YOCAS PROGRAM, IS A USEFUL TREATMENT FOR IMPROVING SLEEP QUALITY AND REDUCING SLEEP MEDICATION USE AMONG CANCER SURVIVORS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
7 2441  31 YOGA AND SCHIZOPHRENIA-A COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT OF NEUROPLASTICITY: PROTOCOL FOR A SINGLE BLIND RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY OF YOGA IN SCHIZOPHRENIA. INTRODUCTION: SCHIZOPHRENIA IS ONE OF THE MOST SEVERE MENTAL DISORDERS WITH A PREVALENCE OF ABOUT 1% AND A LEADING CAUSE OF DISABILITY AMONG YOUNG ADULTS. PHARMACOTHERAPY IS THE MAINSTAY IN THE MANAGEMENT OF SCHIZOPHRENIA. HOWEVER, EVEN WITH THE BEST OF MEDICATION, SEVERAL PROBLEMS LIKE REFRACTORINESS, NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS, FREQUENT RELAPSES, AND COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENTS PERSIST. METHODS: THIS IS A RANDOMIZED-CONTROLLED CLINICAL STUDY INCLUDING PATIENTS FROM AN URBAN TERTIARY HOSPITAL AND A SEMI-URBAN COMMUNITY CENTER, WITH A BETWEEN-GROUP, REPEATED-MEASURES, LONGITUDINAL DESIGN. THIS STUDY WILL RECRUIT 160 PATIENTS WITH DSM 5 DIAGNOSIS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA WHO ARE ON STABLE MEDICATION FOR A MINIMUM OF 6 WEEKS; THEY WILL BE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED INTO 2 ARMS VIZ., YOGA THERAPY (YT), AND TREATMENT-AS-USUAL (TAU) WITH 80 PATIENTS IN EACH ARM. PARTICIPANTS WILL UNDERGO CLINICAL, LABORATORY, AND RADIOLOGICAL ASSESSMENTS AT BASELINE AND AT INTERVALS OF 1 MONTH, 3 MONTHS, AND 6 MONTHS FROM THE BASELINE. IT IS HYPOTHESIZED THAT YOGA WILL IMPROVE PSYCHOPATHOLOGY AND EMOTION PROCESSING, INCREASE SERUM BRAIN DERIVED NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR (BDNF) AND PLASMA OXYTOCIN LEVELS AND EFFECT CHANGES IN CEREBRAL ACTIVATION IN AREAS OF THE BRAIN ASSOCIATED WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA. DISCUSSION: THIS STUDY AIMS TO MEASURE THE EFFICACY OF A YOGA-BASED INTERVENTION AS AN ADJUNCT IN PATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA AS WELL AS THE MECHANISMS OF THESE EFFECTS.

8 2503  21 YOGA AS TREATMENT FOR INSOMNIA AMONG CANCER PATIENTS AND SURVIVORS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. MANY CANCER PATIENTS AND SURVIVORS, BETWEEN 15 TO 90%, REPORT SOME FORM OF INSOMNIA OR SLEEP QUALITY IMPAIRMENT DURING AND POST-TREATMENT, SUCH AS EXCESSIVE DAYTIME NAPPING, DIFFICULTY FALLING ASLEEP, DIFFICULTY STAYING ASLEEP, AND WAKING UP TOO EARLY. INSOMNIA AND SLEEP QUALITY IMPAIRMENT ARE AMONG THE MOST PREVALENT AND DISTRESSING PROBLEMS REPORTED BY CANCER PATIENTS AND SURVIVORS, AND CAN BE SEVERE ENOUGH TO INCREASE CANCER MORTALITY. DESPITE THE UBIQUITY OF INSOMNIA AND SLEEP QUALITY IMPAIRMENT, THEY ARE UNDER-DIAGNOSED AND UNDER-TREATED IN CANCER PATIENTS AND SURVIVORS. WHEN SLEEP PROBLEMS ARE PRESENT, PROVIDERS AND PATIENTS ARE OFTEN HESITANT TO PRESCRIBE OR TAKE PHARMACEUTICALS FOR SLEEP PROBLEMS DUE TO POLY PHARMACY CONCERNS, AND COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY FOR INSOMNIA CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT AND IMPRACTICAL FOR PATIENTS TO ADHERE TO THROUGHOUT THE CANCER EXPERIENCE. RESEARCH SUGGESTS YOGA IS A WELL-TOLERATED EXERCISE INTERVENTION WITH PROMISING EVIDENCE FOR ITS EFFICACY IN IMPROVING INSOMNIA AND SLEEP QUALITY IMPAIRMENT AMONG SURVIVORS. THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF EXISTING CLINICAL RESEARCH ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA FOR TREATING INSOMNIA AND SLEEP QUALITY IMPAIRMENT AMONG CANCER PATIENTS AND SURVIVORS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
9 1227  34 FEASIBILITY AND EFFICACY OF YOGA AS AN ADD-ON INTERVENTION IN ATTENTION DEFICIT-HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER: AN EXPLORATORY STUDY. CONTEXT: ATTENTION DEFICIT-HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER (ADHD) IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON NEURODEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS. STIMULANT MEDICATION IS FREQUENTLY USED IN MANAGEMENT, WITH SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE EFFECTS. THERE IS A GROWING INTEREST IN COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENTS LIKE YOGA. AIMS: TO STUDY THE EFFECTS OF YOGA AS A COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY IN CHILDREN WITH MODERATE TO SEVERE ADHD. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: THE STUDY WAS PERFORMED ON CHILDREN (CONSENT WAS TAKEN FROM PARENTS) ADMITTED IN A CHILD PSYCHIATRY UNIT USING AN OPEN-LABEL EXPLORATORY STUDY. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CHILDREN BETWEEN 5 AND 16 YEARS OF AGE DIAGNOSED WITH ADHD AND CO-OPERATIVE FOR YOGA WERE INCLUDED. SUBJECTS WITH OTHER SERIOUS PSYCHIATRIC AND MEDICAL ILLNESSES WERE EXCLUDED. THE PARTICIPANTS WERE GIVEN YOGA TRAINING DAILY DURING THEIR IN-PATIENT STAY. THEY WERE RATED ON CONNERS' ABBREVIATED RATING SCALE - (CARS), ADHD-RATING SCALE-IV (ADHD - RS IV) AND CLINICAL GLOBAL IMPRESSION (CGI)-SEVERITY, AT THE BEGINNING OF STUDY, AT DISCHARGE AND SUBSEQUENTLY AT THE END OF 1(ST), 2(ND) AND 3(RD) MONTH BY A RESEARCH ASSOCIATE NOT INVOLVED IN YOGA INSTRUCTION. PAIRED T-TEST WAS EMPLOYED TO COMPARE THE MEANS OF SCORES BETWEEN BASELINE AND FOLLOW-UPS. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 9 CHILDREN (8 MALES, 1 FEMALE) WERE RECRUITED INTO THE STUDY. ALL, BUT ONE WERE ON MEDICATIONS. AN AVERAGE OF 8 YOGA TRAINING SESSIONS WAS GIVEN TO SUBJECTS. THEY WERE ABLE TO LEARN YOGA REASONABLY WELL. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THE ADHD SYMPTOMS AS ASSESSED ON CARS (P-0.014), ADHD-RS IV (P=0.021) AND CGI- S SCALES (P=0.004) AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
10  905  24 EFFECTIVENESS OF AN EXTENDED YOGA TREATMENT FOR WOMEN WITH CHRONIC POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER. BACKGROUND: YOGA HAS BEEN FOUND TO BE AN EFFECTIVE POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD) TREATMENT FOR A VARIETY OF TRAUMA SURVIVORS, INCLUDING FEMALES WITH CHRONIC PTSD. AIM/PURPOSE: THE CURRENT STUDY BUILDS ON EXTANT RESEARCH BY EXAMINING AN EXTENDED TRAUMA-SENSITIVE YOGA TREATMENT FOR WOMEN WITH CHRONIC PTSD. THE STUDY SOUGHT TO OPTIMIZE THE RESULTS OF A TREATMENT PROTOCOL EXAMINED IN A RECENT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL WITH A SHORTER DURATION AND WITHOUT ASSIGNMENT OR MONITORING OF HOME PRACTICE. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THE AUTHORS EXAMINED A 20-WEEK TRAUMA-SENSITIVE YOGA TREATMENT IN A NON-RANDOMIZED SINGLE-GROUP TREATMENT FEASIBILITY STUDY FOR WOMEN WITH CHRONIC TREATMENT-RESISTANT PTSD (N = 9). THE AUTHORS EXAMINED PTSD AND DISSOCIATION SYMPTOM REDUCTION OVER SEVERAL ASSESSMENT PERIODS. RESULTS: THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT PARTICIPANTS EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN PTSD AND DISSOCIATIVE SYMPTOMATOLOGY ABOVE AND BEYOND SIMILAR TREATMENTS OF A SHORTER DURATION. CONCLUSIONS: THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT MORE INTENSIVE TRAUMA-SENSITIVE YOGA TREATMENT CHARACTERIZED BY LONGER DURATION AND INTENTIONAL ASSIGNMENT AND MONITORING OF HOME PRACTICE MAY BE MORE ADVANTAGEOUS FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH SEVERE AND CHRONIC PTSD. THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS FOR THE POTENTIALLY MORE SUBSTANTIAL ROLE OF YOGA AS AN INTERVENTION FOR A SUBSET OF ADULTS WITH CHRONIC TREATMENT-RESISTANT PTSD ARE DISCUSSED.	2017

12 2688  29 YOGA IN THE TREATMENT OF MOOD AND ANXIETY DISORDERS: A REVIEW. BACKGROUND: PATIENT USE OF COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS, INCLUDING YOGA, TO MANAGE MOOD AND ANXIETY DISORDERS, HAS BEEN WELL DOCUMENTED. DESPITE RESEARCH INTEREST, THERE ARE FEW RECENT REVIEWS OF THE EVIDENCE OF THE BENEFIT OF YOGA IN THESE CONDITIONS. METHOD: THE PUBMED, MEDLINE AND PSYCINFO DATABASES WERE SEARCHED FOR LITERATURE PUBLISHED UP TO JULY 2008, RELATING TO YOGA AND DEPRESSIVE AND ANXIETY DISORDERS. RESULTS: THE PAUCITY OF REPORTED STUDIES AND SEVERAL METHODOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS LIMIT DATA INTERPRETATION. IN DEPRESSIVE DISORDERS, YOGA MAY BE COMPARABLE TO MEDICATION AND THE COMBINATION SUPERIOR TO MEDICATION ALONE. THERE IS REASONABLE EVIDENCE FOR ITS USE AS SECOND-LINE MONOTHERAPY OR AUGMENTATION TO MEDICATION IN MILD TO MODERATE MAJOR DEPRESSION AND DYSTHYMIA, WITH EARLY EVIDENCE OF BENEFIT IN MORE SEVERE DEPRESSION. IN ANXIETY DISORDERS, YOGA MAY BE SUPERIOR TO MEDICATION FOR A SUBGROUP OF PATIENTS, BUT ITS BENEFITS IN SPECIFIC CONDITIONS ARE STILL LARGELY UNKNOWN. SECOND-LINE MONOTHERAPY IS INDICATED IN PERFORMANCE OR TEST ANXIETY, BUT ONLY PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE EXISTS FOR OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER AND POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER. YOGA APPEARS TO BE SUPERIOR TO NO TREATMENT AND PROGRESSIVE RELAXATION FOR BOTH DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY, AND MAY BENEFIT MOOD AND ANXIETY SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH MEDICAL ILLNESS. IT SHOWS GOOD SAFETY AND TOLERABILITY IN SHORT-TERM TREATMENT. CONCLUSION: REASONABLE EVIDENCE SUPPORTS THE BENEFIT OF YOGA IN SPECIFIC DEPRESSIVE DISORDERS. THE EVIDENCE IS STILL PRELIMINARY IN ANXIETY DISORDERS. GIVEN ITS PATIENT APPEAL AND THE PROMISING FINDINGS THUS FAR, FURTHER RESEARCH ON YOGA IN THESE CONDITIONS IS ENCOURAGED.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
13  906  40 EFFECTIVENESS OF APP-BASED YOGA OF IMMORTALS (YOI) INTERVENTION FOR INSOMNIA IN ASIAN POPULATION DURING PANDEMIC RESTRICTIONS. THE CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 (COVID-19) PANDEMIC CREATED SIGNIFICANT PSYCHOLOGICAL CHALLENGES WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING STRESS, EMOTIONAL DISTRESS, AND INSOMNIA. IN ADDITION, SOCIAL DISTANCING, TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS, AND SPREAD OF DISEASE HAVE RESULTED IN UNIQUE CHALLENGES, CREATING BARRIERS TO HEALTHCARE ACCESS. COMPARED TO THE RATE PRIOR TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN CLINICAL INSOMNIA RATES HAVE BEEN REPORTED. WITH WELL-KNOWN LIMITATIONS OF CURRENTLY ESTABLISHED TREATMENTS (E.G., COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY-INSOMNIA (CBT-I), PHARMACOTHERAPY), THERE IS A NEED TO EXPLORE OTHER EFFECTIVE AND SAFE TREATMENT MODALITIES TO TREAT INSOMNIA, ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT CAN BE USED REMOTELY. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF APP-BASED INTERVENTION TO TREAT INSOMNIA IN THE CURRENT ERA OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC (USING THE YOGA OF IMMORTALS (YOI) APP). THIS PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY WAS APPROVED BY THE INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD. ALL PARTICIPANTS IN THIS STUDY WERE ASKED TO COMPLETE AN ONLINE SURVEY INCLUDING DEMOGRAPHIC DATA AND VALIDATED INSOMNIA SEVERITY INDEX (ISI) AT BASELINE (15 MAY 2020), 4 WEEKS, AND 8 WEEKS AFTER STARTING THE YOI INTERVENTION. SURVEY DATA WAS EXPORTED USING MICROSOFT EXCEL. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS WAS DONE USING THE GRAPHPAD PRISM 8. YOI INTERVENTION SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED THE MEAN ISI SCORES IN ALL CATEGORIES OF INSOMNIA (SEVERE, MODERATE, AND SUBTHRESHOLD) AT EACH FOLLOW-UP (P </= 0.0001). THE IMPROVEMENT WAS SIGNIFICANT AMONG ALL AGE GROUPS AND IN BOTH GENDERS. IN OUR STUDY, YOI WAS A NOVEL AND EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION FOR IMPROVING INSOMNIA SYMPTOMS AND MAY BE A NEW ADDITION TO THE ARMAMENTARIUM OF INSOMNIA MANAGEMENT. BEING APP-BASED, THIS HAS POTENTIAL WIDER APPLICABILITY, ESPECIALLY DURING THE CURRENT COVID-19 PANDEMIC.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
14 1447  30 INDIVIDUALIZED, SINGLE SESSION YOGA THERAPY TO REDUCE PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL SYMPTOMS IN HOSPITALIZED HEMATOLOGICAL CANCER PATIENTS. OBJECTIVE: INPATIENT TREATMENT OF HEMATOLOGICAL CANCER IS AMONG THE MOST PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY ARDUOUS CANCER TREATMENTS, AND IT IS ASSOCIATED WITH A NUMBER OF COMMON PHYSICAL, EMOTIONAL, AND SOCIAL SYMPTOMS THAT CAN NEGATIVELY AFFECT QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) FOR YEARS FOLLOWING TREATMENT. WHILE TREATING SYMPTOMS DURING HOSPITALIZATION HOLDS PROMISE FOR IMPROVING LONG-TERM QOL, SUCCESSFUL APPROACHES LIKELY REQUIRE MULTIDISCIPLINARY INTERVENTIONS. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE DESCRIBE A 4-YEAR EFFORT IN PROGRAM ENHANCEMENT THAT INCORPORATED AN ADJUNCTIVE SINGLE YOGA THERAPY SESSION DURING TREATMENT FOR HEMATOLOGICAL MALIGNANCIES. METHODS: HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS RECEIVING TREATMENT FOR HEMATOLOGICAL CANCER (N = 486) WERE PROVIDED A 40-MINUTE INDIVIDUALIZED YOGA THERAPY SESSION. WE EVALUATED FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTANCE BY QUANTIFYING THE PERCENTAGE OF PATIENTS WHO DISCONTINUED THE YOGA SESSION DUE TO PAIN, DISCOMFORT, OR ANOTHER REASON, AND BY COMPARING THE INTERVENTION POPULATION TO THE DEMOGRAPHIC MAKEUP OF THE UNIT MORE GENERALLY. PATIENT-REPORTED SYMPTOMS WERE OBTAINED BEFORE AND AFTER EACH SESSION, AND WE EVALUATED ACUTE SYMPTOM CHANGE FOR THE ENTIRE SAMPLE AND IN SUBSAMPLES THAT ARE LESS LIKELY TO USE MINDFULNESS-BASED INTERVENTIONS SUCH AS YOGA. RESULTS: THE MAJORITY OF SESSIONS (87%) WERE COMPLETED, AND THE MAJORITY OF UNFINISHED SESSIONS WERE INTERRUPTED BY A MEDICAL PROCEDURE OR BECAUSE THE PATIENT FELL ASLEEP. NO SESSION WAS STOPPED EARLY DUE TO PATIENTS' REPORTED PAIN. SIGNIFICANT DECREASES WERE REPORTED IN ALL SYMPTOMS, WITH THE GREATEST DECREASE IN FATIGUE AND ANXIETY. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA THERAPY WAS A FEASIBLE AND EFFECTIVE NONDRUG ADJUNCT INTERVENTION FOR HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS RECEIVING TREATMENT FOR HEMATOLOGICAL CANCER, INCLUDING BONE MARROW TRANSPLANTATION.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
15  252  25 A YOGA PROGRAM FOR THE SYMPTOMS OF POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER IN VETERANS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PILOT STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF A YOGA PROGRAM AS AN ADJUNCTIVE THERAPY FOR IMPROVING POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD) SYMPTOMS IN VETERANS WITH MILITARY-RELATED PTSD. VETERANS (N = 12) PARTICIPATED IN A 6 WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION HELD TWICE A WEEK. THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN PTSD HYPERAROUSAL SYMPTOMS AND OVERALL SLEEP QUALITY AS WELL AS DAYTIME DYSFUNCTION RELATED TO SLEEP. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN THE TOTAL PTSD, ANGER, OR QUALITY OF LIFE OUTCOME SCORES. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THIS YOGA PROGRAM MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE ADJUNCTIVE THERAPY FOR IMPROVING HYPERAROUSAL SYMPTOMS OF PTSD INCLUDING SLEEP QUALITY. THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATES THAT THE YOGA PROGRAM IS ACCEPTABLE, FEASIBLE, AND THAT THERE IS GOOD ADHERENCE IN A VETERAN POPULATION.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
16 2235  31 THE IMPACT OF YOGA UPON FEMALE PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM HYPOTHYROIDISM. OBJECTIVE: TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF FEMALE HYPOTHYROID PATIENTS. DESIGN: THE WHO QUALITY OF LIFE SCALE(22) WAS USED TO ASSESS THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF 20 FEMALE HYPOTHYROID PATIENTS. SUBJECTS ATTENDED ONE HOUR YOGA SESSIONS DAILY FOR A PERIOD OF ONE MONTH. A PRETEST-POST-TEST RESEARCH DESIGN WAS USED FOR DATA ANALYSIS. RESULTS: PATIENTS' QUALITY OF LIFE SCORES FOLLOWING THE YOGA PROGRAM WERE GREATER THAN SCORES OBTAINED PRIOR TO UNDERTAKING YOGA (P < 0.01). PATIENTS ALSO REPORTED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THEIR PERCEPTION OF THE OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE AND OF THEIR HEALTH POST YOGA INTERVENTION. CONCLUSIONS: IT CAN BE CONCLUDED THAT YOGA IS VALUABLE IN HELPING THE HYPOTHYROID PATIENTS TO MANAGE THEIR DISEASE-RELATED SYMPTOMS. YOGA MAY BE CONSIDERED AS SUPPORTIVE OR COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY IN CONJUNCTION WITH MEDICAL THERAPY FOR THE TREATMENT OF HYPOTHYROID DISORDER.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
17 1732  39 PERSPECTIVE OF PATIENTS REFERRED TO YOGA CENTER IN A TERTIARY NEUROPSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL: A CROSS-SECTIONAL RETROSPECTIVE STUDY. BACKGROUND: YOGA HAS BEEN EXTENSIVELY USED AS AN ALTERNATIVE OR COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY IN PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS DEPENDING ON THE TYPE AND SEVERITY OF THE DISORDERS. HOWEVER, DATA RELATED TO PERSPECTIVE ON YOGA SERVICES AND THE BENEFITS AND ADVERSE EFFECTS ATTRIBUTED TO YOGA BY PATIENTS WITH MAJOR PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS IS LACKING. AIM: THE AIM OF THE STUDY WAS TO ASSESS FEEDBACK OF THE PATIENTS WHO ATTENDED YOGA SESSIONS AT A YOGA CENTER IN A TERTIARY NEUROPSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THIS WAS A CROSS-SECTIONAL RETROSPECTIVE STUDY USING A SPECIFIC QUESTIONNAIRE TO GET FEEDBACK FROM PATIENTS REFERRED TO THE NIMHANS INTEGRATED CENTER FOR YOGA, AT THE END OF THEIR YOGA TRAINING. RESULTS: TWO HUNDRED AND ONE PATIENTS' DATA WERE INCLUDED IN THIS RETROSPECTIVE STUDY. MOST OF THE PATIENTS WERE REFERRED BY THE DOCTORS. THE YOGA MODULE FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA WAS MOST COMMONLY UTILIZED, FOLLOWED BY DEPRESSION. ON AN AVERAGE, PATIENTS ATTENDED 13 SESSIONS. MOST OF THEM PRACTICED YOGA FOR 1-2 WEEKS AND HAD MISSED LESS THAN 2 SESSIONS. THE GREAT MAJORITY OF THE PATIENTS REPORTED THAT PRACTICING YOGA HELPED THEM. SPEARMAN CORRELATION ANALYSIS REVEALED POSITIVE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN IMPROVEMENT ATTRIBUTED TO YOGA AND VARIABLES AFFECTING QUALITY OF YOGA SERVICES AT THE CENTER, INCLUDING THE QUALITY OF YOGA SESSIONS ATTENDED. OVERALL HEALTH AND SLEEP IMPROVEMENT ALSO POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH IMPROVEMENT ATTRIBUTED TO YOGA. A MINORITY OF PATIENTS REPORTED ADVERSE EFFECTS, ALTHOUGH THESE DID NOT LEAD TO DISCONTINUATION. CONCLUSION: IN THIS RETROSPECTIVE STUDY OF PATIENTS REFERRED TO A YOGA CENTER IN A TERTIARY PSYCHIATRIC FACILITY, THE MAJORITY OF PATIENTS WITH MAJOR MENTAL DISORDERS WERE ABLE TO PRACTICE YOGA UNDER SUPERVISION AND REPORTED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN SYMPTOMS WITH MINIMAL ADVERSE EFFECTS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
18 1223  28 FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OF RESTORATIVE YOGA FOR TREATMENT OF HOT FLUSHES: A PILOT TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OF A RESTORATIVE YOGA INTERVENTION FOR THE TREATMENT OF HOT FLUSHES IN POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN. METHODS: A PILOT TRIAL IN 14 POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN EXPERIENCING > OR =4 MODERATE TO SEVERE HOT FLUSHES PER DAY OR > OR =30 MODERATE TO SEVERE HOT FLUSHES PER WEEK. THE INTERVENTION CONSISTED OF EIGHT RESTORATIVE YOGA POSES TAUGHT IN A 3-H INTRODUCTORY SESSION AND 8 WEEKLY 90-MIN SESSIONS. FEASIBILITY WAS MEASURED BY RECRUITMENT RATES, SUBJECT RETENTION AND ADHERENCE. ACCEPTABILITY WAS ASSESSED BY SUBJECT INTERVIEW AND QUESTIONNAIRES. EFFICACY MEASURES INCLUDED CHANGE IN FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF HOT FLUSHES AS RECORDED ON A 7-DAY DIARY. RESULTS: RECRUITMENT WAS ACCOMPLISHED AS PLANNED. THE MAJORITY OF STUDY SUBJECTS (93%) COMPLETED THE TRIAL. OF THOSE WHO COMPLETED THE TRIAL, 92% ATTENDED SEVEN OR MORE OF THE EIGHT YOGA SESSIONS. THE MAJORITY OF THE SUBJECTS WERE SATISFIED WITH THE STUDY AND 75% CONTINUED TO PRACTICE YOGA 3 MONTHS AFTER THE STUDY. MEAN NUMBER OF HOT FLUSHES PER WEEK DECREASED BY 30.8% (95% CI 15.6-45.9%) AND MEAN HOT FLUSH SCORE DECREASED 34.2% (95% CI 16.0-52.5%) FROM BASELINE TO WEEK 8. NO ADVERSE EVENTS WERE OBSERVED. CONCLUSIONS: THIS PILOT TRIAL DEMONSTRATES THAT IT IS FEASIBLE TO TEACH RESTORATIVE YOGA TO MIDDLE-AGED WOMEN WITHOUT PRIOR YOGA EXPERIENCE. THE HIGH RATES OF SUBJECT RETENTION AND SATISFACTION SUGGEST THAT YOGA IS AN ACCEPTABLE INTERVENTION IN THIS POPULATION. OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT A LARGER, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL TO EXPLORE THE EFFICACY OF RESTORATIVE YOGA FOR TREATMENT OF MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS WOULD BE SAFE AND FEASIBLE.	2007	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
19  682  34 EFFECT OF ADJUNCT YOGA THERAPY IN DEPRESSIVE DISORDERS: FINDINGS FROM A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY. BACKGROUND: DEPRESSION CAUSES SIGNIFICANT BURDEN BOTH TO THE INDIVIDUAL AND TO SOCIETY, AND ITS TREATMENT BY ANTIDEPRESSANTS HAS VARIOUS DISADVANTAGES. THERE IS PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE THAT ADDS ON YOGA THERAPY IMPROVES DEPRESSION BY IMPACTING THE NEUROTRANSMITTERS INVOLVED IN THE REGULATION OF MOOD, MOTIVATION, AND PLEASURE. OUR STUDY AIMED TO FIND THE EFFECT OF ADJUNCTIVE YOGA THERAPY ON OUTCOME OF DEPRESSION AND COMORBID ANXIETY. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY INVOLVING PATIENTS WITH MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER (N = 80) WERE ALLOCATED TO TWO GROUPS, ONE RECEIVED STANDARD THERAPY (ANTIDEPRESSANTS AND COUNSELING) AND THE OTHER RECEIVED ADJUNCT YOGA THERAPY ALONG WITH STANDARD THERAPY. RATINGS OF DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY WERE DONE USING MONTGOMERY-ASBERG DEPRESSION RATING SCALE AND HOSPITAL ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SCALE AT BASELINE, 10(TH) AND 30(TH) DAY. CLINICAL GLOBAL IMPRESSION (CGI) SCALE WAS APPLIED AT BASELINE AND 30(TH) DAY TO VIEW THE SEVERITY OF ILLNESS AND CLINICAL IMPROVEMENT. RESULTS: BY THE 30(TH) DAY, INDIVIDUALS IN THE YOGA GROUP HAD SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER SCORES OF DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AND CGI SCORES, IN COMPARISON TO THE CONTROL GROUP. THE INDIVIDUALS IN THE YOGA GROUP HAD A SIGNIFICANT FALL IN DEPRESSION SCORES AND SIGNIFICANT CLINICAL IMPROVEMENT, COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP, FROM BASELINE TO 30(TH) DAY AND 10(TH) TO 30(TH) DAY. IN ADDITION, THE INDIVIDUALS IN THE YOGA GROUP HAD A SIGNIFICANT FALL IN ANXIETY SCORES FROM BASELINE TO 10(TH) DAY. CONCLUSION: ANXIETY STARTS TO IMPROVE WITH SHORT-TERM YOGA SESSIONS, WHILE LONG-TERM YOGA THERAPY IS LIKELY TO BE BENEFICIAL IN THE TREATMENT OF DEPRESSION.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
20 1556  36 LONG-TERM CHANGES OF SYMPTOMS OF ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, AND FATIGUE IN CANCER PATIENTS 6 MONTHS AFTER THE END OF YOGA THERAPY. BACKGROUND: SYMPTOMS OF ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, AND CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE ARE COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH CANCER. CANCER PATIENTS INCREASINGLY USE COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS, SUCH AS YOGA, TO COPE WITH PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL IMPAIRMENTS. IN THE PRESENT ARTICLE, LONG-TERM CHANGES OF ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, AND FATIGUE IN CANCER ARE EXAMINED 6 MONTHS AFTER A YOGA INTERVENTION. METHOD: WE USED AN OBSERVATIONAL DESIGN BASED ON A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY IN CANCER PATIENTS WITH MIXED DIAGNOSES TO EVALUATE LONG-TERM CHANGES OF SYMPTOMS OF ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, AND FATIGUE 6 MONTHS AFTER THE END OF YOGA THERAPY. WE MEASURED ANXIETY SYMPTOMS WITH THE GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER SCALE (GAD-7), DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS WITH THE PATIENT HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE-2 (PHQ-2), AND FATIGUE WITH THE EUROPEAN ORGANIZATION FOR RESEARCH AND TREATMENT OF CANCER QUALITY OF LIFE QUESTIONNAIRE-FATIGUE SCALE (EORTC QLQ-FA13). YOGA THERAPY WAS PROVIDED IN YOGA CLASSES OF 60 MINUTES EACH ONCE A WEEK FOR 8 WEEKS IN TOTAL. THE EXERCISES PROVIDED CONTAINED BOTH BODY AND BREATHING ACTIVITIES AS WELL AS MEDITATION. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 58 PATIENTS PARTICIPATED IN THE STUDY. SIX MONTHS AFTER THE END OF YOGA THERAPY, SYMPTOMS OF ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, AND FATIGUE WERE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED COMPARED WITH BASELINE. HOWEVER, SYMPTOMS OF ANXIETY AND FATIGUE SLIGHTLY INCREASED DURING THE FOLLOW-UP PERIOD, WHEREAS SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION REMAINED STABLE. CONCLUSION: OUR RESULTS ARE PROMISING AND SUPPORT THE INTEGRATION OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS IN SUPPORTIVE CANCER TREATMENT CONCEPTS BUT SHOULD BE CONFIRMED BY RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS. LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF YOGA THERAPY ON CANCER PATIENTS SHOULD BE THE SUBJECT OF FURTHER RESEARCH.	2019
